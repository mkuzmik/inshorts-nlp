The international trade secretary told the Sunday Times it would only be \"100% certain\" if MPs back the deal.  He said if the deal is rejected, that \"would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and Parliament\". MPs are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement in January, with the UK scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March.  The agreement negotiated by Mrs May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force with a majority backing in Parliament. The Commons vote was due to be held on 11 December but the PM postponed it once it became clear it would be defeated by a large margin. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn this week urged Mrs May to cut short MPs' Christmas break - they are due back in the Commons on 7 January - to allow for an earlier vote. Mr Fox has warned fellow MPs that failure to pass the deal would be \"incendiary\" and said it was \"a matter of honour\" for them to support the PM. He said: \"What you can be sure of is that if we vote for the prime minister's deal then it's 100% certain that we will leave on 29 March. \"If we do not vote for that, I'm not sure I would give it much more than 50-50. \"And, for me, that would induce a sense that we had betrayed the people that had voted in the referendum.\" Please upgrade your browser Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the campaign for another referendum, said: \"The only thing that is shattering the bond of trust between electorate and Parliament is the refusal of ministers like Liam Fox to trust people with the final say on Brexit.\" If Mrs May's deal is rejected, the default position is for the UK to leave in March unless the government seeks to extend the Article 50 negotiating process or Parliament intervenes to stop it happening. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has urged the UK to \"get your act together and then tell us what it is you want\" for Brexit. Speaking to the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, he said it was \"unreasonable\" for parts of the British public to expect Brussels to solve \"British problems\". Mr Juncker also rejected the idea that the EU wanted to keep the UK in the EU \"by all possible means\" and suggested the majority of MPs \"deeply distrust\" the EU and Theresa May.

Southampton responded to David Silva's early opener when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg took the ball off Oleksandr Zinchenko and fired it into the top corner. City had luck on their side when Raheem Sterling's shot deflected off James Ward-Prowse to make it 2-1. Sergio Aguero's back-post header completed the scoring before half-time. Southampton goalscorer Hojbjerg - who had only just returned from suspension - was shown a straight red card for a lunging tackle on Fernandinho with just over five minutes to go. City had a number of decent chances as Silva, Aguero and Riyad Mahrez all went close in the first half and Aguero smacked the crossbar after the break. Southampton threatened too and Charlie Austin was twice denied by City keeper Ederson in the first half before Hojbjerg's equaliser. But the Saints were ultimately undone by Pep Guardiola's free-flowing side, who move up to second place in the table. Liverpool went 10 points clear of City at the top of the table with a devastating 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal on Saturday, meaning the defending champions needed victory to keep pace in the title race. City appeared to feel the pressure on Boxing Day when they squandered an early lead and allowed Leicester to win 2-1 at the King Power Stadium.  But they stood up to the challenge at St Mary's - peppering Southampton's goal from the off and responding to the equaliser with two quick goals on the stroke of half-time. City's opening goal was straight from Guardiola's textbook: Bernardo Silva's neat build-up down the right and cut-back into the centre was comfortably put away by an unmarked David Silva. Sterling's shot was then deflected by Ward-Prowse and flapped into the net by Alex McCarthy to make it 2-1 before Aguero headed in Zinchenko's cross at the back post with ease.  It means City can cut Liverpool's lead to four points when the two teams meet at the Etihad Stadium on 3 January. The last time Southampton played City in early November they were hammered 6-1 and failed to respond to three early goals. But this time Southampton posed a threat and came close to breaking down a slightly nervy City defence on occasions. Austin's header at the near post was well saved by Ederson in the first half and that came moments after the keeper had avoided Hojbjerg's sliding tackle on the goal-line.  And Saints' pressing paid off when Hojbjerg robbed Zinchenko of the ball in the build-up to his equaliser. City could not extend their lead in the second half but Southampton's good work was only undone by the late sending-off of Hojbjerg. A trip to Stamford Bridge is a difficult start to the new year but the Saints will likely avoid the drop if they can produce performances like this in the second half of the season.  Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"The first 15-20 minutes we were not very good but we smelt a bit of sensation when we equalised. We saw that Man City is not that confident in the moment like they are when they win week after week. We tried to push ourselves back into the game and press a little bit earlier but we saw when they have time to turn they are dangerous. \"At half time we thought about preparing the guys for a good second half but in the mind was also the next game against Chelsea. And then the worst thing happened in the red card for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg which is disappointing because he is one of the most important players in our team.  \"In a game which is 3-1 and with only five minutes to go, you have to ask the use of such a tackle. He knows it was the wrong decision but it doesn't help us in the moment.\" \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It was important to win after two defeats and the players did what they had to do. If one team achieves 100 points and then the year after make 45 in the first round it is not all bad. \"Before 1-1 we played to score more, then they scored and the game was more equal but we carried on and scored the second goal.

Kante scored the only goal of the game in the 51st minute when he broke forward from midfield to convert David Luiz's throughball. There were few clear-cut chances as the Blues dominated possession and Palace sat back hoping to catch the opposition on the counter-attack - a tactic which failed to work as Roy Hodgson's Eagles took 85 minutes to register their first effort. That is now two successive games without a goal. Chelsea's Willian came close to scoring with a free-kick that struck the post, and Ross Barkley also hit the woodwork with a hooked effort. Fourth-placed Blues now have 43 points, one behind City and two behind Spurs. Palace remain in 14th with 19 points. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The Kante of 2018-19 is made up of different spec to previous models. Gone is the role of anchor man in midfield - the ball-winner who would allow other midfielders to make forays into the opposition's final third. The remodelled version has been given permission to burst forward from the right of a midfield trio. During a largely nondescript opening 45 minutes, he made two runs into the Palace box - the first resulting in a strike that missed Vicente Guaita's far post by two feet. Sarri's perseverance with the tactic paid off six minutes after the break when Kante grabbed his third goal of the season after again breaking from midfield. This time it was defender Luiz the provider, with a threaded pass that found the Frenchman whose shot had enough power to beat the hand of the former Valencia keeper. Willian also went close for the Blues with a free-kick that came off the Palace post, while fellow midfielder Barkley hooked a shot from close range that grazed the woodwork. It was a competent if unremarkable display from Sarri's side, but they did not have to break sweat against a lifeless Palace attack. This was an utterly forgettable display by Palace.  They defended admirably but appeared to show little desire to put pressure on the opposition backline. Their first effort on goal came in the 85th minute when Wilfried Zaha fired wide and high, before substitute Connor Wickham's strike from six yards resulted in a similar outcome. Hodgson grimaced from the sidelines, as must have the Palace supporters inside Selhurst Park. The former England manager explained that his side stuck to their defensive tactics after Chelsea scored because of the risk of \"conceding another three or four\". \"I thought we worked as hard as we could have,\" he said. \"We kept them in front of us and they had the ball, but they were creating goal chances. \"When they scored we had two options; either fly at it and risk conceding another three or four, or keep it tight and try and win an undeserved point in the last 15 minutes.\" Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a difficult match. I am happy with the team because we dominated for 85 minutes, although we didn't kill the match, so we had to fight again for the last five minutes.\" On Kante's goal: \"He is improving with the right timing and good movement and now I think that we have to work on Ross Barkley. We now need continuity because in the last five matches we played very well in three, and badly in two, so now is the moment to have continuity. \"We have to play 19 matches, so other team's results are not important but it is crucial to have continuity. In two days we have had four injuries, with Cesc Fabregas, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Danny Drinkwater, and then today Olivier Giroud.

The hosts began the final day on 258-8 chasing an unlikely 399, but after rain delayed the start, India needed only 4.3 overs to wrap up the win. Jasprit Bumrah, who took career-best match figures of 9-86, had Pat Cummins edge to slip for 63, before Nathan Lyon gloved Ishant Sharma behind. The fourth and final Test starts in Sydney on 2 January. Bumrah's haul was the best by an India pace bowler in Australia and the 25-year-old leads the series standings with 20 wickets, three more than Australia spinner Lyon. \"Credit has to go to the bowlers. I think they have been outstanding, especially Jasprit. The way he bowled in this Test match was outstanding,\" said India captain Virat Kohli, whose side will retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. \"The mindset he has at the moment is what separates him from anyone else in the world right now. He looks at a pitch and he doesn't think it's a hard toil, he thinks wickets, he thinks 'how can I get a breakthrough for the team'. \"What I've seen in the last 12 months is the way he has matured in Test cricket and the way that he is bowling so soon, so quickly in his Test career, I think is a very scary sign for all the batsmen around the world. \"I mean, in Test cricket if there is a pitch like Perth, I wouldn't want to face Jasprit Bumrah, to be honest, because once he's on a roll he can really crank it up.\" India bounced back after losing the second Test in Perth to declare twice at the MCG, with their bowlers tearing Tim Paine's side apart for 151 and 261. The defeat in Melbourne came in Paine's sixth Test match as Australia captain after replacing Steve Smith, who was banned along with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft for ball-tampering during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March. Smith and Warner's year-long suspensions will expire in late March 2019, and Paine admitted Australia missed their presence following a poor batting performance. \"I think it's inexperience, it's pressure, India's bowling attack is probably as good as most of us have ever played,\" he said. \"I think it's pretty clear that if you take two or three of the best players out of anyone's line-up around the world, you're going to struggle a little bit at times and you are going to have inconsistent performances. \"The silver lining is that we do have world-class players that are available soon to come back into this side, and clearly when they do they will make a huge difference.\" With several players under pressure for their place, the Aussies have added all-rounder Marnus Labuschagne to their squad for the final Test.

It said it would be willing to work with the US to \"implement the important consensus\" reached at December's G20. At the Buenos Aires summit the two countries agreed to suspend new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. China's statement comes after President Donald Trump tweeted \"big progress\" was being made in relations after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made! End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump In Saturday's tweet, the US president said \"talks were moving along very well\". Sunday's statement from Lu Kang, the spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry, appeared to confirm President Trump's optimism. \"China stands ready to work with the US to implement the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and President Trump in Argentina, expand co-operation on the basis of mutual benefit, manage differences on the basis of mutual respect,\" Mr Lu said. Prior to the G20 meeting in Argentina, the US had warned it was considering 25% tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3152bn) of Chinese goods - more than double the 10% initially planned. The White House says the tariffs are a response to China's unfair trade policies, which Mr Trump blames for helping to create a huge trade deficit. Mr Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to make trade fairer for the US, and repeatedly blamed China's trading practices for making American manufacturers less competitive. The US imposed tariffs on a number of Chinese products, including consumer and industrial items such as handbags and rice. China responded in kind, and both sides - the world's two largest economies - ended up imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of goods. The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Tariffs ended up raising costs for American companies. Analysts say this is one of a number of factors that have put pressure on markets in recent weeks. In early December, Mr Xi and Mr Trump met after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires for the first time since their trade war started. Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January, and the US said China would buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products. The details of that deal are yet to be ironed out, however.

The move  further strengthens the board as pledged by founder Elon Musk to the Securities and Exchanges Commission. The SEC fined Mr Musk over misleading tweets that he had funding to take Tesla private. Investors greeted the news by sending Tesla shares up more than 4% in morning Friday trading.  Elon Musk remains as chief executive although he agreed with the SEC in October he would step down as chairman.  Larry Ellison is the co-founder and chairman of enterprise cloud software firm Oracle - currently the third largest software maker in the world after Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet.  He already owns three million shares of Tesla stock and is a close friend of Mr Musk.  Actor Robert Downey Jr modelled the character of Tony Stark on Mr Musk for the film Iron Man in 2008, and in 2010, Mr Musk and Mr Ellison famously made cameo appearances in Iron Man 2 as fellow tech billionaires.  Kathleen Wilson-Thompson is the global head of human resources at international pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, and was previously an executive at Kellogg.  The new appointments follow November's move by Tesla to appoint Australian telecoms executive Robyn Denholm as its new chairman. In August, Mr Musk posted a tweet saying that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker off the stock market and make it a private company. He claimed that the funding proposal would value Tesla at $420 per share. Shares in the company briefly rose after his announcement, but later fell again. The SEC said the claim was \"false and misleading\", and decided to sue him for alleged securities fraud. Although he agreed to step down as chairman and pay a $20m (\u00a315m) settlement fine, Mr Musk said recently that he does not respect the SEC. The SEC settlement follows a turbulent year for Tesla and Mr Musk.  In February, Tesla reported a record quarterly loss, partly caused by the carmaker's revamp of its manufacturing process to boost output of the Model 3. The revamp was needed after a surge of orders in 2017 saw it struggling to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers. This prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings. In June, Tesla cut 9% of its workforce as part of a restructuring intended to reduce costs and boost profitability. In October the carmaker reported a quarterly profit for just the third time in its 15-year history. In a striking and emotional interview to the New York Times in August, Mr Musk said he had not been on drugs when he posted the tweets about taking Tesla private. He did however say that he was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks, and that the past year had been the \"most difficult and painful\" of his career.

The Chinese company's chairman has also complained of his firm's \"incredibly unfair treatment\" abroad. In recent weeks, the UK's Defence Secretary and chief of MI6 have been among those to warn that use of Huawei's 5G kit poses risks that need fuller consideration. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and Japan have also flagged concerns. Experts have warned that the Chinese government could compel the company to disrupt telecom networks that use its equipment or spy on their customers. But Huawei denies it would ever do so, noting that such action would undermine its business.  Last week, it invited the media to visit its 5G and cyber-security research labs in Dongguan, Guangdong as part of efforts to counter criticism.  Many of Huawei's clients opt for its products over rivals, such as Nokia and Ericsson, on both cost and technical grounds.  In addition, its smartphones have proven popular with the public.  Huawei recently revealed it had shipped more than 200 million handsets in 2018, placing it second only to Samsung in terms of market share.  \"We are ahead of others in domains like wireless, optical, data communications, and smart devices,\" wrote chairman Guo Ping in a New Year's message shared online. \"For 5G markets that choose to not work with Huawei - they will be like an NBA [National Basketball Association] game without star players: the game will go on, but with less deftness, flair, and expertise.\" Beijing's criticism of the UK was published in the Global Times, an English-language government newspaper.

It said Wu's comment was made in reaction to UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson saying earlier this week that: \"We've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.\" Having made play on a Jane Austen novel title, the newspaper also referenced another popular phrase to offer advice to Huawei, telling it to \"calm down and carry on\" in a separate editorial.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46691846", "content": "A majority stake in Gatwick Airport is to be sold to French operator Vinci Airports for \u00a32.9bn.  Vinci Airports, part of infrastructure group Vinci, will buy 50.01% of the UK's second-busiest airport.  The other 49.99% will be managed by current owners Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). The airport was closed in the run-up to Christmas after reports of drone sightings, in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind. Flights were grounded and about 140,000 passengers affected over three days during the incident. In 2016, Gatwick's expansion plans were dealt a blow when the government rejected its proposal for a new second runway while giving the go-ahead for Heathrow to build a third runway. Gatwick was acquired by a GIP-led consortium in 2009. More than 45 million passengers travel through Gatwick each year, flying to 230 destinations in 70 countries, according to its website. The deal would make Gatwick the largest airport in Vinci's network, which will grow to 46 airports in 12 countries - with a total traffic of about 228 million passengers a year, according to the company. It follows Vinci's takeover of Airports Worldwide's portfolio earlier this year, which included Belfast International and stakes in 12 airports across the US.  Commenting on recent disruption at Gatwick, Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports, said he had \"every confidence\" in the teams currently in place.  \"We will of course work with the airport operational team and the existing shareholders to make Gatwick as resilient as it can be in the face of these new risks,\" he added. Before Christmas, Gatwick was in the public eye for all the wrong reasons. It  was brought to a standstill and around 1,000 flights were cancelled due to apparent drone activity. But the fact remains, London's second airport is potentially a lucrative asset. It handles more than 45 million passengers every year and makes hundreds of millions of pounds in profit.  Vinci says it also offers \"significant potential for growth\". The question is, where will that growth come from? Gatwick is already operating at a high level of efficiency, squeezing the maximum number of landings and takeoffs from its single runway. Its proposal to build a second runway was rejected by the government in 2016. But it has a back-up idea. Earlier this year, it set out a \"masterplan\" for the future - which suggested that an emergency standby runway could be expanded and brought into daily use, to increase capacity. That would certainly be a controversial move - but if it succeeded, there could be major benefits for Vinci. So perhaps the French firm thinks it's worth a gamble. US-based GIP said it expected the transaction to be completed \"by the middle of next year\".

This week we speak to Andy Mooney, chief executive of US guitar company Fender, and formerly a senior executive at both Nike and Disney. Andy Mooney was standing in line at an ice rink in Phoenix, Arizona, when he had a eureka moment that continues to earn entertainment giant Disney more than $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) a year. This was back in 2000, soon after Mr Mooney, a Scot, had been appointed head of Disney's consumer products division. Joining the company after 20 years at Nike, he was working hard to bring himself fully up to speed on every facet of the business. This included going to see a production of Disney on Ice, where figure skaters portray Disney characters. While queuing to get in he noticed that a great many of the young girls - and also their mothers - had dressed up in generic princess dresses, to look like Disney heroines, such as Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. Disney didn't sell such dresses at the time, but Mr Mooney immediately realised that the company was missing an incredibly lucrative trick. \"I was standing in line with mothers and daughters, all dressed head to toe in princess regalia that they had made at home,\" says Mr Mooney, 63. \"I said to a few of the mums 'if Disney made official dresses like this would you buy them?', and they all replied that they'd buy lots. \"So I rushed back to [Disney headquarters] in Burbank [Los Angeles], and we launched the Disney Princess series pretty quickly.\" Not only did Mr Mooney and his team introduce dresses based on those worn by Disney's best-known female characters, they set to work on everything from books to lunchboxes, dolls, magazines, computer games, pyjamas, and tie-ups with food producers. The idea was to start selling basically everything that female Disney fans, both young and old, might like to buy, all featuring one or more Disney princess. \"By the end of 2001 sales across the Disney Princess lines were something like $300m, and today it is more than $6bn a year,\" he says. This is not the success in life that Mr Mooney could have dreamed of when he grew up in a council house in the small Scottish town of Whitburn, half way between Glasgow and Edinburgh. The son of a miner, he left school at 16 to train as an accountant at his local tyre factory. Yet from this modest start, he went on to play a key role in the growth of US footwear and sportswear company Nike. And after his success at Disney, he is now chief executive at Fender, which - for someone who has been an avid guitar player since he was a teenager - is his \"dream job\". After a number of years at the tyre plant Mr Mooney switched to a similarly unglamorous junior accountancy role at the local ironworks. Then aged 25, in 1980, he took his first steps towards to the top of the US corporate world when he applied for, and got, the job as chief finance officer of Nike's UK operation. \"In the interview they didn't ask me anything to do with my accountancy background, it was all about whether I was a cultural fit,\" says Mr Mooney. At the time Nike was primarily selling running shoes, so to best understand the business and his products Mr Mooney says he switched from playing football to jogging. \"I picked up running when I joined, and I have stuck at it ever since, running marathons around the world,\" he says. While Mr Mooney's day job was a financial one, he started to impress his bosses with his gut instinct for what shoes would sell particularly well, and how Nike could best sell more of them.  So much so that Nike UK switched him to head of marketing in 1982. Two years later he was poached by the marketing team at Nike's head office in Oregon, rising to the become chief marketing officer. While at Nike Mr Mooney was a key mover behind the introduction of special limited editions trainers, when inspiration came to him at a set of traffic lights. \"I had become relatively successful, so I could afford to buy a very bad used Porsche 924,\" he says. Then a guy pulled up alongside me in a bright yellow 924, and I went 'what the hell is that?'. I discovered that it was a limited edition version of the car, and I wondered if that would work in shoes... It was a big success.\" After 20 years at Nike Mr Mooney says that Disney approached him, and he left for a fresh challenge in 2000, taking up the head of consumer products role. He stayed with Disney for 11 years before leaving to spend just 26 months as chief executive at sportswear brand Quiksilver, where he admits that for once things didn't work out for him. When he joined Quiksilver it was struggling with debts of more than $1bn. The top position at Fender followed in 2015, which Mr Mooney says really is \"an honour\" for someone who already had a collection of more than 40 guitars. More The Boss features: While he says that Fender's annual turnover is a very respectable $500m, he wants to help increase this by reducing the number of people who give up on trying to learn to play their guitar. \"The industry has a retention problem,\" he says. \"Some 45% of guitars we sell go to first time buyers, half of whom are women, but 90% of all new players then abandon the instrument in the first year.\" To help more people learn how to play their guitar (and then potentially buy another), Fender launched \"Fender Play\" last year, online guitar tutorials that are now used by 70,000 people. Mark Ritson, adjunct professor of marketing at Melbourne Business School, says: \"Andy Mooney is an unusual chief executive. \"He has a strong marketing background, and has proven adept at first understanding the customers his businesses were targeting, and then using that knowledge to diversify and grow revenues. \"His role at Fender will be to do that again. The fact that he plays a mean guitar does him no harm either.\" When not busy at work Mr Mooney now jams with some of his guitar heroes, such as Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine, and Jim Root of Slipknot. And he has swapped Scotland for Los Angeles' exclusive Hollywood Hills. \"I do have to pinch myself,\" he says.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46699288", "content": "US financial markets were mixed on Friday after a choppy trading session that bounced between gains and losses. The Dow Jones index sank 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell about 0.1%, but the Nasdaq gained almost 0.1%. The moves marked a relatively calm end to a wild week of trade, in which US indexes rallied sharply after plunging on Monday. European markets built on those gains on Friday. The FTSE 100 share index closed up more than 2.2% at 6,733.97. In Germany, the DAX gained about 1.7%, while France's CAC index also rose about 1.7%. Many markets have had a dismal year, as investor sentiment soured on fears of decelerating global growth, trade tensions and rising interest rates. Japan's Nikkei suffered its first annual loss in seven years, while Germany's Dax index closed the year down about 18% - the biggest annual loss in a decade. On Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.31% lower at 20,014.77, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed flat, at 25,504.20. In the US, Friday's declines were fairly widespread. However, they spared the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers such as Amazon. Amazon shares jumped more than 1% on Friday, days after the  e-commerce giant told investors it had a \"record-breaking\" holiday season. Analysts cautioned that movements were exacerbated by the lower dealing levels seen during holiday trading. US shares have been hit this week by weaker than expected home sales and consumer confidence data. Concerns about US-China trade tensions also resurfaced, with reports saying US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order banning the use of Chinese technology.

So very sad. I once sent a letter to many actors as a budding (I mean desperate) comedy actor to ask for sponsorship for the Edinburgh Festival. Dame June replied. Fifteen years later when I met her she had all my letters and the notes of the show she sponsored.

Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus all had their troubles but managed to escape the year without seeing their brands trashed in quite the same way as their parent. So, it's no surprise to see articles related to Facebook's various scandals secured it three of the spots in BBC Tech's most-read stories list for 2018. Two other controversy magnets - Elon Musk and Huawei - however, narrowly missed out.  And for the first time since we started compiling this list in 2012, none of the placings went to a product launch. Below are the most clicked on articles for each month of the year - a mix of controversy, endeavour and sparkly revenge. January: Chipocalypse Now Software flaws have long been a bane of computing, but when news emerged of serious vulnerabilities in popular processor chips there was a serious intake of breath from the cyber-security community. Billions of PCs, smartphones and other devices were said to be susceptible to the Meltdown and Spectre bugs - including, as it emerged, Apple's products. At one point there was talk of owners having to brace themselves for their machines feeling noticeably more sluggish as a result of the workarounds that would be needed, or even needing to send their computers in for component swap-outs. A year on, there doesn't appear to have been any malware related to the flaws reported in the wild, even though further variants of the originally disclosed exploits have been discovered.  And as far as personal computers are concerned, the patches released don't appear to have caused much of a hit to performance. February: Fake porn Deepfakes gave the internet something else to worry about in February, after it emerged that free software meant anyone could replace the face of one person with another's in video footage so long as you had enough photos of the latter. Inevitably, the tool was used to create pornography with a range of predominantly young female celebrities' features generated to supplant those of the original adult actresses. One after another websites lined up to ban the content until Reddit, which had been home to much of it, decided to do likewise. As the algorithms involved have improved, there has been much discussion about the danger of fake news creators adopting the face-mapping technique  to create bogus videos of politicians. But there's another worrying trend.  It appears that some Deepfakers are attempting to scrape social media for images of acquaintances that they can turn into pornography, and have been sharing details of their progress in chat forums. March: Cambridge Analytica Donald Trump's election in 2016 helped put Cambridge Analytica in the public eye after reports that its psychological profiles of US voters had helped his campaign target messages. But the London-based consultancy only became a household name after a report in the Observer explained how the firm had made use of millions of harvested Facebook accounts' details, while a follow-up Channel 4 TV report recorded the consultancy's chief on tape discussing how beautiful girls could be sent to a politician's house  as a honey-trap. Facebook also found itself in the firing line. It didn't help itself by first trying to suppress the story and then quibbling over whether it warranted being described as a \"data breach\". Yesterday @facebook threatened to sue us. Today we publish this. Meet the whistleblower blowing the lid off Facebook & Cambridge Analytica. https://t.co/QcuBJfBU5T End of Twitter post  by @carolecadwalla When Mark Zuckerberg did finally apologise several days later, he made a promise that has been repeatedly thrown back at him since. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he said. April: Scandal grows By early April, Facebook was estimating that up to 87 million of its members' details had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. More than a million of them were thought to belong to UK-based users.  This was based on the number of accounts that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - had harvested from the social network via a personality quiz. Soon after, Cambridge Analytica responded that its parent, SCL Elections, had in fact \"only\" licensed 30 million people's records from Dr Kogan, and all, it said, had been from US citizens. That wasn't enough to save it - the political consultancy folded in May. But it now forms part of Facebook's defence against a fine from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which was imposed despite the watchdog acknowledging that it had found no evidence that UK citizens' data had been passed to Cambridge Analytica. The \u00a3500,000 amount is peanuts to the social network - it makes more in half an hour, and the reputational damage it has incurred has arguably been far more costly. But Facebook is concerned that the penalty could set a precedent for other data regulators to follow. May: RIP TotalBiscuit The British video games critic John \"TotalBiscuit\" Bain had first told his fans and wider following that he had cancer in 2015. By April 2018 the 33-year-old had announced he was retiring from journalism as the medication he was on was preventing him from thinking clearly. Even so, his death shocked and saddened many of his 2.2 million YouTube fans when it was confirmed. The obituaries that followed mostly focused on how he had championed indie games and criticised some of their bigger-budgeted rivals, which he had said sometimes prioritised profit over all else.  But on social media and in some later articles, there was criticism of the role Mr Bain had played in the GamerGate movement. It was claimed he had given legitimacy to a misogynistic campaign that had been responsible for the harassment of others.  But this in turn spurred on his supporters to defend his legacy. They said his involvement had been mischaracterised and noted that Mr Bain had called for ethics in games journalism for several years before GamerGate existed. June: Data from the deep The phrase \"the cloud\" conjures up images of our data being stored in some nebulous form high above us. In reality, tech firms are investing billions of pounds in racks of computer servers housed in gigantic data centres across the globe to power the apps we use and internet services we call on. For the most part, these are built at ground-level. But in June, Microsoft sank an experimental data centre into the sea off Orkney in the north of Scotland. The idea is to reduce cooling costs by keeping the equipment in a sealed vault underwater. The tech giant intends to monitor Project Natick for five years to see if the scheme is a practical proposition for a wider rollout. But elsewhere, Google revealed it had already made the switch to liquid-cooling to tackle the heat given off by its latest artificial intelligence-focused computer servers. But rather than dropping its equipment overboard, it is piping coolant to each chip. July: Thoughtless threat PayPal was guilty of a major faux pas when it wrote to Lindsay Durdle, one of its recently deceased customers, to say her death was a breach of its rules. To make matters worse, it added that it might take legal action as a consequence. Her husband Howard Durdle was appalled, and to be fair so was PayPal's PR team when the BBC brought the matter to its attention. Although the firm was unable to confirm exactly what had gone wrong it attempted to make good on the situation by writing off a debt his wife had owed. \"PayPal have been in touch, have apologised sincerely and have promised to change whatever they need to internally to ensure this can't happen again,\" Mr Durdle tweeted after the BBC's article was published. \"I just hope more organisations can apply empathy and common sense to avoid hurting the recently bereaved.\" August: Mystery satellite As official statements go, the US State Department's wasn't the most reassuring: \"We don't know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it.\" The subject was a Russian satellite that had been launched 10 months earlier and was displaying abnormal behaviour.  One US official suggested it could be a space weapon designed to destroy other satellites - an allegation a Russian diplomat slammed as being \"unfounded [and] slanderous\". For those who track such developments, the US's suspicions echoed those raised about another Russian launch four years earlier when what was thought to be a bit of debris started zipping about in orbit. In any case, at the end of the year we are officially none the wiser about the objects true capabilities.  But with the Trump administration pursuing its own plan to create a Space Force by 2020, off-planet militarisation looks set to remain a hot topic. September: Facebook flaw With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still ratting along, Facebook revealed that a separate problem had exposed almost 50 million accounts to being hijacked. The cause was a vulnerability in the code of its View As privacy facility, which was designed to let users see what their profile looked like to others. At the time, Facebook said it was \"temporarily turning off\" the tool while it conducted a review. Three months on, it remains disabled. The firm did, however, revise its estimate down to 30 million accounts. While we're on the topic, here's some of Facebook's other controversies in 2018: In an end of year message posted yesterday, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had become much more \"proactive\" at addressing the challenges it faced but warned some problems could \"never be fully solved\". But overall, he said he was \"proud of the progress\" Facebook had made in 2018. October: Power struggle Many of us have experienced the sinking feeling that comes from leaving the home in the morning to discover your smartphone battery never recharged overnight. Typically, it's a case of failing to properly plug the handset in. But a YouTuber's tests of the latest iPhones indicated some of the new devices only topped up their power if their displays were \"woken up\" first.  Inevitably this was dubbed \"chargegate\",  and when the BBC published its take on the issue Apple had yet to comment. But a week later, when it released the next version of its mobile operating system, Apple's accompanying notes confirmed it had fixed a bug that had caused the flaw. November: #Dontbeevil At the start of the year the Time's Up movement was founded to take a stand against sexual assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace. It was a response to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein but also marked an effort to tackle problems faced by women more widely. Eleven months later, seven of Google's employees declared \"time's up\" on the tech giant after accusations of misconduct emerged involving two past male high-fliers as well as dozens of other staff. As a result, workers at Google's offices across the world staged a series of walkouts. Managers were delivered a set of demands, including a call to end the firm's requirement that sexual harassment disputes be dealt with internally. About a week later, Google's chief Sundar Pichai confirmed that the business would indeed stop its policy of forced arbitration, opening the door to it being sued over the matter in the future. December: Glitter bomb The internet fell in love with a revenge prank staged by an ex-Nasa engineer earlier this month. After having a package stolen from his porch, Mark Rober constructed a \"bomb\" that married a centrifugal motor, lots of glitter, fart spray and several smartphones. He then hid the device within an Apple Homepod speaker box and left it on his porch. When thieves subsequently stole it, it recorded the moment it sprayed them with its contents. After which, Mr Rober retrieved the package and repeated the exercise. In an ideal world, the story would have ended there, with Mr Rober's YouTube fame assured thanks to the compilation video he made. But a couple of days after uploading the footage,  the inventor replaced the video with a shorter edit. Some viewers had voiced suspicions about parts of the footage, and Mr Rober acknowledged that when he had chased up their concerns he had discovered that one of his helpers had recruited acquaintances to pose as two of the five featured thieves. An important note: pic.twitter.com/9MgQFVbhoB End of Twitter post  by @MarkRober \"I'm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn't just taint the entire effort as 'fake',\" he tweeted. Most viewers seem to have been forgiving, but it's unfortunate that what was a fun stunt might cause many to be more suspicious and cynical about what they see online in the future.

District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, said the Washington Post.  It accused Facebook of allowing the wholesale scraping of personal data on tens of millions of users.  The action adds to a number of regulatory investigations, following a year of privacy and security missteps.  A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: \"We're reviewing the complaint and look forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in DC and elsewhere.\"  As well as this lawsuit, Facebook is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.  In the UK, the company was fined \u00a3500,000 over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the maximum fine the British data regulator could impose. Bigger trouble may arise from the Irish data protection regulator, which is investigating Facebook for multiple admissions of security flaws, in what is being seen as the first major test of Europe\u2019s new privacy rules as dictated by the General Data Protection Regulation.  According to the Post, the DC attorney general\u2019s action could be amended to include more recent data security admissions, including more revelations published on Wednesday by the New York Times.

But this popularity is fairly recent. Why have podcasts taken so long to become visible, and does that mean you can make a living out of them? It's easy to make a podcast.   All you need is something you want to say, a microphone, a recording device (known as a tape recorder in the old days) and some editing software.   For enthusiasts, part of the beauty of audio has always been that you don't have to be a technological wizard to create something magical. While podcasts have been around for a good decade and a half, they've emerged from their niche recently thanks to the proliferation of smartphones, podcast apps and voice-activated speakers in homes. Plus, their more informal, less \"produced\" style is proving popular with the much sought-after \"millennial\" generation, says Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism in New York. \"What podcasting has is a youth audience that feels very passionately about the people that they listen to and that they engage with.\" And the old problem of visibility has largely been solved by distribution platforms from the likes of Apple, SoundCloud and Whooshkaa, although it's still true that old fashioned word-of-mouth is one of the most effective ways of getting your podcast noticed. Now there are more than 600,000 shows worldwide covering everything from sport, politics and music, to the thoughts of geeks in their bedrooms. The podcast has become fashionable. And not just in the West. South Korea tops the global rankings, according to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2018, with 58% of its population listening to a news podcast in the past month, compared with 33% in the US and 18% in the UK. Young people are now far more likely to listen to podcasts than to speech radio, Reuters says. \"What distinguishes radio from TV is the intimacy. What distinguishes a podcast from radio is that it's intimacy plus, because you've chosen it and it's literally in your ears,\" explains Olly Mann, who's been co-hosting Answer me This since 2007 with comedian Helen Zaltzman, and now also produces The Modern Mann. \"People tend to listen on headphones in their personal bubble.\" He describes the growth in podcasts as a \"slow, gentle upward curve\", but like others, acknowledges that there is one show responsible for propelling the genre into the mainstream: Serial.  In October 2014, the team behind the successful public radio programme This American Life released the first episodes of their true crime story set in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Serial broke the mould because it was a podcast first, not just a radio show uploaded to the internet after broadcast, as was typical at the time. Producer Julie Snyder says this meant that if the show flopped, they hadn't wasted too much time, money or reputation. But listeners were gripped by reporter Sarah Koenig's investigation into the murder of high school student Hae Min Lee and the conviction and imprisonment of her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed.  Now in its third season, Serial has been downloaded 420 million times in total. And it's testament to the influence of Season One that Syed has been granted a retrial.  Source: Wired, Global, Vulture Lists \"A lot of people were not used to hearing non-fiction serialised storytelling that's as compelling as Serial was,\" says Ms Snyder. \"And because the technological barriers had sort of come down, it was really easy to get at. For the first time a lot of people learned how to access a podcast.\"  Its success encouraged many listeners to explore what else was out there, she believes. But how do you make money from podcasting? Here's where it gets a little complicated. Once you've pressed Save on your programme, you need a hosting platform to which you can drag and drop your show.  That platform creates an RSS (\"rich site summary\" or \"really simple syndication\") feed - the link between your audio file and the so-called pod catchers - programs that download and distribute the podcasts to your listening device. \"It's a very fragmented marketplace,\" says Ross Adams, chief executive of Acast, the Stockholm-based podcasting platform that hosts 3,500 podcasters.   Acast not only looks after the technical nuts and bolts, but also the advertising that gives podcasters a chance to monetise their content.  In common with other digital platforms, Acast's global sales teams sells advertising on a \"cost per mille\" (CPM) basis.  So if your podcast has 1,000 listeners and there are six ad slots, that adds up to a total of 6,000 impressions, or clicks, to sell. But podcast advertising doesn't come cheap. Airtime ads start at about \u00a312 ($15) CPM, but some branded content may sell for as much as \u00a3100 ($126) CPM, says Mr Adams. More Technology of Business \"It's the most expensive priced audio product in the marketplace,\" says Mr Adams, largely because podcast audiences tend to be affluent and audio ads are effective, particularly if they're read out by the programme host.  \"It's not a commercial radio audience that's listening, it's the Netflix subscriber, the Spotify premium subscriber,\" he says. \"It's the very affluent audiences, which is why we can charge a lot higher.\" This sounds like good news for the impoverished podcaster, but bear in mind that as far as spending on digital advertising goes, audio is still the poor relation to video, where revenue is measured in billions, rather than hundreds of millions.  Nevertheless, a report for the Interactive Advertising Bureau by consultants PWC predicts advertising revenues in the US digital audio sector will grow more than 110% to $659m (\u00a3521m) by 2020. It's that sort of upward trend that has convinced industry heavyweights like the UK radio company Global to launch a podcasting service on its global player app. Networks like Radiotopia and Gimlet Media, and platforms and apps like Acast and Global, help make the podcast visible to listeners and advertisers, and because they aggregate podcasters, even those with lower download figures stand a chance of attracting advertising. That said, the marketplace is still too crowded for many people to make serious money.   \"For anybody who wants to make a living on it there's nowhere near enough money,\" says Emily Bell. \"I'm sure probably over 80% of the revenue goes to the top 20% of the podcasts.\"  But audio has never been all about the money. It's a medium for enthusiasts produced by enthusiasts. And podcasts may have secured its future.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46717535", "content": "\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Pep Guardiola says Manchester City have to \"accept\" that title rivals Liverpool could be the \"best team in the world right now\". Defending champions City, who beat Southampton 3-1 on Sunday, go into Thursday's home game against Liverpool seven points adrift of the Reds. \"The problem is the other team is fantastic,\" said Guardiola. \"[Liverpool are] maybe the best team in Europe or the world right now and in top form.\" While City have suffered defeats against Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Leicester in December, Liverpool have won every single game they have played. They ended 2018 in style, beating Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield to briefly go 10 points clear of City. Speaking about Liverpool's ability, Guardiola added: \"You have to accept it. All we can do is do our job, play our games and after that we will see.\" In addition to their dominant position in the league, Liverpool have a recent edge over City because they knocked the Blues out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals last season. If the Reds were to win on Thursday, they would restore their 10-point cushion and become heavy favourites to win a first league title since 1990. City captain Vincent Kompany said the game against the league leaders is the type of match \"you live for\". \"Our pride has been hurt over recent weeks but we have everything to play for.

The 26-year-old Australia batsman, whose ban ended on Saturday, lasted only three deliveries in the Scorchers' 107-8 in Launceston. Bancroft was caught using sandpaper to alter the condition of the ball against South Africa in Cape Town in March. The Hurricanes chased 108 to win by six wickets with 15 balls to spare. A fourth successive victory extended their lead at the top of the table to four points. Bancroft, who came in at number five with the Scorchers 16-3, collected two to square leg off the first ball he faced. He defended his next delivery before edging Riley Meredith behind as he attempted to force off the back foot. Meredith finished with 3-15, while Jofra Archer, who will qualify for England in 2019, returned figures of 0-26 and England's David Willey made six off 13 balls.

The year began with an Ashes drubbing for England, featured a fairytale summer farewell and ended with Virat Kohli arguing with someone. Again. Oh, and some Australians got banned for cheating along the way. BBC Sport hands out the prizes after a tumultuous year in the cricket world. Surely you don't need to ask? Already India captain, totem and icon, Virat Kohli proved this year he is unquestionably the best player in the world. If his returns in Test cricket were impressive - 1,322 at an average of 55 - his one-day international haul of 1,202 at 134 bordered on ludicrous. He arrived in England this summer with question marks over his claims to greatness. He responded by averaging 59 in a series when most batsmen survived as long as an ice cube on a warm day. Despite defeat in England, Kohli led India to a first Test win in Australia in 10 years - and they will begin 2019 as they did 2018, as officially the best side in the world. If New Zealand had played more than six Tests, Kane Williamson - with an average of 67 - might have run Kohli close, while Alyssa Healy won a staggering four player-of-the-match awards in six games as Australia women romped to the Women's World Twenty20 title. Alastair Cook and James Anderson can accept this award on behalf of their scriptwriter, who delivered an end to the summer so joyful that it made the Shawshank Redemption finale look positively miserable. From the moment Cook, the holder of almost every England Test batting record there is, announced the final Test against India would be his last, you sensed it might be emotional. Walking out to bat, taking guard, maybe even adjusting his box - Cook was given countless standing ovations before he sent the Oval crowd into a frenzy with a fairytale farewell century in his final innings. Anderson supplied the encore the following day with his 564th Test wicket, taking him past Australia great Glenn McGrath as the most successful pace bowler of all time and wrapping up a 4-1 series win. Cook called Anderson the greatest player of all time. Anderson said the same about Cook. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. Cameron Bancroft, take a bow. The Australia batsman wins this from a field of one, although he might ask Steve Smith and David Warner to accompany him to the awards ceremony. Bancroft was caught during the Cape Town Test against South Africa trying to scuff up the ball using sandpaper - which he then tried to hide down his trousers. All in full view of the television cameras. Bancroft was banned for nine months, while captain Smith and vice-captain Warner - both of whom admitted knowing about the plan - got a year apiece. Sympathy was in short supply. The Australian and British prime ministers put the boot in, and Smith and Warner blubbed like three-year-olds in news conferences broadcast around the world. Coach Darren Lehmann said he didn't know about the sandpaper plan and wouldn't resign. Then he did. Needless to say, there were tears there too. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Australia fans, look away again. A couple of hefty defeats on that ill-fated tour of South Africa were contenders for this prize - Australia lost the third Test by 322 runs and the fourth by 492 - and they were crushed by 373 runs by Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. But the biggest thumping of the year was dished out by England, who won the third one-day international against Australia by 242 runs. The hosts smashed the ODI record in making a scarcely believable 481-6 at Trent Bridge. Alex Hales battered 147 off 92 balls, Jonny Bairstow 139 off 92. Australia were bowled out for 237, with 13 overs unused. There must have been a temptation for England to let them have another go. It was Australia's heaviest one-day defeat in terms of runs. They lost the series 5-0. The flight home could not come soon enough. Bangladesh gave it their best shot when they were bowled out for 43 by West Indies, while South Africa laid claim to the award in being skittled for 73 in 29 overs in Sri Lanka.  Pakistan losing their last seven wickets for 41 runs as they contrived to lose the first Test by four runs against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi was mightily impressive in its own way. However, at a time when England seem intent on bringing the collapse back into fashion, it simply had to be Joe Root's side who collected this gong. Playing their first Test since being thumped 4-0 in the Ashes, England folded like a cheap deckchair against New Zealand as they were bowled out for 58 in the face of some admittedly excellent swing bowling from Trent Boult and Tim Southee. It was their sixth lowest total in Test history. The innings barely lasted 20 overs. Five batsmen made ducks. Only two reached double figures. One saving grace for England was that, from 27-9, it could have been even worse. A tough one, mainly because there has been plenty of anger on and off the cricket pitch this year. It began with CCTV footage of Australia's David Warner and South Africa's Quinton de Kock being separated by team-mates in the stairwell outside the changing rooms in Durban. It continued with a pumped-up Kagiso Rabada shoulder-barging Steve Smith in the very next Test in Port Elizabeth. Confrontation is like oxygen to the scowling India skipper Virat Kohli, although his 'mic drop' impersonation in an attempt to rile Joe Root at Edgbaston proved fruitless. The award, though, goes to England's Jonny Bairstow, who 'celebrated' his century against Sri Lanka on his return to the side by ripping off his helmet, dropping his bat and letting out a roar that would not have been out of place in WWE. That he was miffed at what he perceived as criticism from the media made it all the more remarkable. Anyone who can have an argument in an empty room deserves to win this prize. Amelia Kerr smashed a women's record 232 not out off 145 balls for New Zealand in an ODI in Ireland. Then she took 5-17. Best of all, she was only 17 at the time. Australia seamer Andrew Tye, who conceded an eye-watering 0-100 from nine overs in England's ODI-record 481 at Trent Bridge.  Glenn Maxwell's remarkable effort to remove Faf du Plessis, leaping to catch the ball at long-on, throwing it up in mid-air while over the boundary, jumping back inside the rope and completing the catch on the run. In an age when exceptional catches have almost become the norm, this was still something else. Remember Mason Crane? The leg-spinner took 1-193 in the final Ashes Test in Sydney, the most expensive figures by an England debutant. A back injury forced him home from the New Zealand tour that followed, then ended his county season in June. Joe Denly. Aged 32 and out of the England side for more than eight years, the Kent all-rounder was recalled for the winter tour to Sri Lanka. In his first game back, he only went and won the man-of-the-match award, with 20 off 17 balls and 4-19 opening the bowling with his leg-spin. David Warner, one of cricket's most notorious sledgers, walked off the field mid-innings during a Sydney grade match after receiving a few choice words from Jason Hughes, the brother of the late Phillip Hughes. While what was said remains a mystery, the irony was not lost on anyone. With all due respect to the record-breaking Alastair Cook and the cuddly old-timer Rangana Herath, AB de Villiers is a clear winner of this award. An entertainer, innovator and all-round good egg, he scored more than 20,000 runs for South Africa in all forms of the game. None of them could be described as ugly. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Can you name the bowler with the best Test figures of 2018? Didn't think so. It's time to doff your cap to South Africa left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took 9-129 against Sri Lanka in July. South Africa still lost by 199 runs. Congratulations to the Joyces. Ed, the former England batsman, called time on a distinguished 21-year career after playing in Ireland's inaugural Test in May, and his sisters Isobel and Cecelia followed suit when Ireland bowed out of the Women's World Twenty20 in November. Surrey may not be the most popular team in county cricket, but not even their harshest critics could fail to be impressed by the manner in which they dominated the County Championship this summer. They won a first title for 16 years with two games to spare - and did it thanks to 13 home-grown or academy players. An award you didn't expect to be reading about, but the England and Wales Cricket Board's decision to reduce the residency qualification rules for overseas-born players from seven years to three means we could all enjoy the supremely talented Jofra Archer - born and raised in the West Indies, now playing for Sussex - wearing an England shirt in the not-too-distant future.

He went into the game as the league's top scorer but had just 13 touches before being substituted in the 71st minute. To make matters worse, SIX of those touches were from the kick-off. Don't believe us? Here's his touch map to prove it. As the map shows, the Gabon international was only given the ball once in the Liverpool penalty area and more of his touches come in his own penalty area than Liverpool's. Aubameyang's 13 touches was his lowest total in any game he has started this season and only Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has had fewer touches when playing at least 70 minutes in the Premier League this season - he had 11 touches in 87 minutes for Leicester against Arsenal in October. Unsurprisingly, Aubameyang also made the fewest passes of any player to have played the majority of the match. He made just 10 passes although they were all successful so he ended the game as the only player with 100% passing accuracy.

Unseasonable heat in the dead of winter? Steven Gerrard's team turned up the temperature, that's for sure. Their victory was scalding and wholly deserved. After 10 defeats and two draws in 12 meetings with Brendan Rodgers' team that saw them produce performances that ran the gamut from A for Abysmal to Z for Zzzzz, Rangers finally stirred and gave Celtic a little glimpse of life on the other side. The Scottish champions turned up at Ibrox for a game of football. Rangers turned up for a battle. If this game was won, ultimately, by a goal from Ryan Jack, its foundations were built on attitude and work-rate and fitness to go like the clappers all day long, on Gerrard devising a perfect game plan that was carried out to the letter by an infinitely hungrier team. Not to mention Rodgers getting his team selection wrong and then it being exposed. The hosts hustled and harried Celtic to the point of distraction and disorientation. Dedryck Boyata, Scott Brown, Olivier Ntcham and others will wake up in the night imagining that Jack and Ross McCrorie were in the room with them, tipping them out of their bed. Scott Sinclair, Ryan Christie, James Forrest will think about the last time they were all so ineffective in a game of this kind. That'll take a while. None of Celtic's go-to men in attack were mapped.  Celtic's disintegration was something to see. Every pass - even the simple ones - became an adventure. For a spell, you waited for them to regain their composure and mount an assault down the other end, but you abandoned expectation pretty early in the day. Rangers' intensity was far, far too much for them.  Their only comfort - and it doesn't even amount to a crumb - was that they avoided the kind of outcome that would have been on sale as a DVD come Monday morning. By any reasonable analysis, on the balance of chances created, Rangers were at least three goals better than Celtic at the very minimum. Four would be closer to the mark. Five would not have flattered them.  At the end, the cameras turned to Gerrard in the most significant moment of his brief career in management. Gerrard needed this, no question. After dropping points in nine league games this season - and staring down the barrel of a six-point deficit on a Celtic team with a game in hand - he needed the validation that he was on the right track domestically. That even if Rangers don't win the league, that he shows himself capable of giving Celtic under Rodgers a bloody nose as others have done before him. Hibernian have done it, Hearts have done it, Kilmarnock have done it, Aberdeen have done it and now Rangers have joined the party at last at the 13th attempt since the Celtic manager hit town. From now until the end of the season, Gerrard can put this victory on the television screen in the team room and say, 'that's your level now, that's what your capable of, that's what we want every week, that's what will make us contenders'. For Rangers, the thought of beating Celtic is no longer an abstract thing. The win strips away a layer of Celtic's aura. Rodgers' team have now lost four league games in the first half of this season, which is the same number of losses they suffered in the past two league seasons put together. Talking about them being beatable is all well and good, but Rangers don't need to talk about it anymore. They've experienced it. The question for Gerrard is about consistency. Can he dig out displays like this on a regular basis going forward? Can he bring to an end soft points getting dropped on the road? Now that he's applying some heat to Rodgers' rear end, can he keep it applied or will a silly draw here and a weak loss there undermine it all?  The winter break is upon us but when they return to league action Rangers have a pocket of games that will tell us much about their durability in what we must now call a title race. Three points separate the top four clubs at the midway stage. How long it lasts is a moot point - Celtic remain hot favourites - but in the here and now there is a chase on for sure.  Those games facing Rangers are Kilmarnock (away), Livingston (away), St Mirren (home) and Aberdeen (away). Their travails have been mostly on the road in the Premiership this season. They've had a flakiness at Livingston, Motherwell and Dundee - where they should be winning - and it has hurt them. If they leave Rugby Park, the Tony Macaroni Arena and Pittodrie with nine points, they'll have built on what they achieved against Celtic on Saturday and the feeling will harden that, maybe, they are in this for the long haul.  There's a transfer window to negotiate in the meantime. Rangers made a \u00a314m loss in their last accounts but the temptation of seeing the whites of Celtic's eyes will surely see them spend again. Gerrard has already spoken about strengthening and his words will only take on greater persuasiveness after what happened at Ibrox. Another option up front is the first priority.  For Celtic, this should come as an awakening. They dozed their way through the summer window and their lack of action contributed heavily to their exit from the Champions League. It's now putting an element of doubt about their domestic dominance.  Mr Magoo can see what they need in the next window - one more striker, possibly two, and a right-back to replace Mikael Lustig. That's the least of it. Rangers exposed Celtic in the heart of the midfield where Brown and Ntcham were thunderously outplayed. That might give Rodgers food for thought also. He ought to be chastened by what became of his team at Ibrox. The same can be said of Peter Lawwell. The chief executive would never want Celtic to lose to Rangers, but losing so soon after it was reported that he is about to pocket a performance bonus of more than \u00a32m to go with his salary of \u00a31.1m is particularly wounding. That news will have gone down badly with the faithful, but it's grist to Rodgers' mill as he looks for proper money to reinvent his team. Like Gerrard showing his board the DVD of the game in a bid for new funds, Rodgers can do exactly the same for altogether different reasons.  The Celtic manager hasn't had many poor days in Scotland, but this was the worst of them. There's a little chink in the armoury now. And everyone can see it. ", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46663364", "content": "Burnley manager Sean Dyche says a couple of \"big decisions\" in his team selection contributed to a vital win over West Ham at Turf Moor. Goalkeeper Tom Heaton excelled after being recalled at the expense of Joe Hart and 19-year-old Dwight McNeil, also included as one of five changes to the side thumped 5-1 by Everton on Boxing Day, scored the Clarets' second goal. \"Joe has been magnificent for us and credit to him because he was the first to jump up at the end when Tom makes a big save,\" said Dyche, who had seen his side lose their previous three league matches.  \"I decided the time was right for Dwight, who is a clever player who has some quality and ability. His family should take some pride in what he's doing. He'll get stronger and fitter and we hope he'll continue growing with the team.\" Chris Wood put Burnley in charge with a right-footed finish from the left of the penalty area to conclude a sweeping move involving Heaton, Ashley Westwood, McNeil and Ashley Barnes. And with the hosts repeatedly carving through the visitors, they pressed home their advantage before the interval, when 19-year-old McNeil turned in Westwood's cross at the far post.  It was a disappointing end to a strong December for West Ham, who arrived in Lancashire on the back of five wins from six games. Despite the return of Marko Arnautovic, playing for the first time since injuring his hamstring at Cardiff on 4 December, Manuel Pellegrini's side were sluggish throughout with their best chance, a header from substitute Andy Carroll, drawing a fine save from Heaton late on.  The only crumb of comfort for the Hammers was that both Wood and Barnes spurned several excellent opportunities after the break to make Burnley's win more emphatic. The win lifts Burnley above Fulham into 18th and level on points with 17th-placed Southampton, who lost to Manchester City.  A run of six defeats from their last seven games has raised question marks over Dyche's position for the first time in his six-year tenure.  While the club finished seventh in the Premier League last season, that success was largely built on a solid defensive base. In contrast, the defence has been porous this term - leaking 41 goals so far, two more than the entire 2017-18 campaign. And with failed attempts to combat that problem including the deployment of five defenders in their last three matches - all ending in defeats - Dyche reverted to type with a 4-4-2 formation. Wood and Barnes offered physicality in a two-man attack and club captain Heaton's return to the line-up proved inspired.  Over 15 months had elapsed since Heaton dislocated his shoulder at Crystal Palace - the last time he featured in a league game for Burnley - but the 32-year-old exerted his influence on those in front of him, barking out instructions and providing organisation and leadership. That contributed to West Ham managing just four shots on target and Heaton's understanding with his team-mates was evident as he raced out of his goal in the 15th minute to instigate the move that ended with Wood's goal. Heaton positioned himself to calmly head the ball to Westwood under pressure from West Ham attackers, and he underscored a good day's work by superbly tipping Carroll's header on to the woodwork late on. A position just outside the top six felt like an implausible proposition for West Ham after they lost their opening four games but Pellegrini's side had the opportunity to move up to seventh at kick-off.  Instead this turned into a second blip in an otherwise fruitful December, their other defeat this month, against Watford, also a 2-0 reverse. \"It was frustrating because we wanted to win this game and had the chance to be seventh but we lacked energy to win it,\" Pellegrini said. \"We had a flight that arrived at 2am in the morning after playing Southampton. I was happy until two o'clock today. This was a game we were able to win - Burnley was in a bad moment but they played with intensity. Burnley recovered better because they had 30 or 35 hours' more [rest].\" Brazilian midfielder Felipe Anderson has played a principal role in West Ham's upturn but he struggled to make an impact against well-drilled and determined opponents. Anderson won just 31% of his duels and his passing accuracy was also below par at 64%. And with West Ham's most creative player on the periphery it allowed Burnley to assume control.   Anderson was far from the only visiting player to underwhelm, though. Lucas Perez and Robert Snodgrass were withdrawn at half-time after ineffective displays, which contributed to the visitors managing just one shot in the first period.  The introduction of Carroll did add power and presence but the Hammers were unable to provide the aerial service he thrives on until the closing minutes.

Impact. Shock. A familiar crumple of leather and bone. And then panic. Ian Hutchinson, with a mantelpiece full of trophies but a body full of pain, is back lying in the middle of the road. He doesn't know why he's crashed, but he knows that his leg is badly broken. Again. Ian Hutchinson, with 30 major operations already behind him and with 50 hours on the operating table already in the tank, knows he's now got more to come. But first he's got to get out of the way.  Ian Hutchinson, who came close to having a foot amputated after a 2010 crash which shattered the same leg which is now twisted at a sickening angle, has just seconds before the next motorbike racing the famous Isle of Man TT course comes past at over 100mph. He levers himself to the roadside despite having a visibly shattered femur, narrowly avoiding the fast arriving Norton of Dave Johnson.  His storied career could have been ended on that sunny Isle of Man afternoon. But instead, after another gruelling year of recovery and rehab, Hutchison will go for a 17th TT win this weekend. Why?  Because, in his own words, \"Life's made for a challenge, isn't it?\" 'You're not amputating my foot! I need it' To understand the full scale of Hutchinson's personal ride through the peaks and troughs of life as a road racer, we need to first rewind to the autumn of 2010. After six years of progress, the then 30-year-old was at the top of his game after becoming the first rider in history to win all five TT races in a single week.  He sold up, capitalising on the prize money to move into a dream house which needed major renovations - and within a few months he was in the same boat. A freak crash in the rain at Silverstone saw a fellow rider run over his leg, causing major damage which would rule out much of the next five years of Hutchinson's career. \"It was high-energy open fracture, it came out of the skin,\" he says. \"My leg was in a million bits. \"When it first happens you don't have any pain, you are in shock. I looked down and could see bones sticking out the back of my leathers and my leg just dangling down. Then you panic. \"The three arteries feeding my foot with blood weren't working. So they were going to amputate my foot. My foot was dead. \"They were showing me my foot and it was purple but I didn't know what they were on about, I just kept saying 'you're not taking it off. I'll never ride a bike again.'\" Hutchinson's persistence won out - not for the first time in this story - and his foot was saved. Enter surgeon Matija Krkovic, who attached a metal cage - a Taylor spatial frame - around Hutchinson's mangled leg and started the slow, painful process of rebuilding his tibia. Or to be more accurate, regrowing it from scratch. The cage holds bone fragments in place with wires through the skin which are then turned every six hours, forcing the bone apart and promoting new bone to grow. Each day brings growth of 1mm. Each cm of new bone then takes a further month to consolidate. In three separate sessions since his 2010 accident Hutchinson has now grown 210mm of new bone in his left leg. Over eight inches.  \"At the start with the cage on it's horrible,\" says Hutchinson, who has now spent 1,200 days since the autumn of 2010 with the contraption on his leg. \"You can't sleep. You're up all night on morphine, you're drowsy all day.  \"I'd just peaked in my career in 2010, everything was going so well. I'd been putting everything into racing for so long and I'd just got there and it was all taken away from me.  \"The first time I did have doubts if I could carry on. I thought 'should I be really doing this?'\" The injury of 2010 started a period of almost three years of rebuilding for Hutchinson. He missed the 2011 season, had the cage removed and signed up to race in 2012 before breaking the leg again in an accident at a bike show when he slipped on a concrete floor. He didn't know it at the time, but Hutchinson was approaching his lowest point of all. \"I slipped off a little kid's motocross bike,\" he said. \"I didn't know the leg was broken again. \"I walked away, at that point I thought my leg was fixed for good. But I had the frame back on, they said it would be three months. \"That was the beginning of February 2012 and it should have been removed for the second time just in time for the TT that year. I went back on 30 April for an X-ray, expecting the frame to come off that day, and they said the bone was infected. It was weak and that is why it had broken. \"They told me they were going to have to remove a big piece of bone and start all over again. That was the lowest point, the closest I came to crying. They said it would be another 18 months to fix it.\" It can take a rider years to learn the TT course, with each 37.7-mile lap containing 227 corners which carve a route through villages and across the Snaefell mountain, the riders hitting 200mph at parts - all on public roads. It is an unforgiving place. Just this week local rider Dan Kneen became the 149th rider to lose their life in the event's 111-year history. Having already missed the 2011 race, Hutchinson knew that missing 2012 could be the end of his career. So he decided to race anyway - despite his busted leg - postponing his next battle with the cage and covering his injury with a homemade cast that was thin enough to go under his leathers. \"I had to keep my eye in and race that year,\" he said. \"The plaster cast was far too thick so I had some carbon fibre in the garage and made my own cast which was 2mm thick. \"I didn't tell anyone what had happened, I just told them that my leg was fixed. I couldn't tell anybody, I wouldn't have been able to race. \"Potentially that was stupid. I asked the surgeon if racing would cause any more damage and he said 'your leg is in such a mess anyway, if you crash it will pull it off.' \"I said 'if I crash at the TT my leg will be the least of my worries.'\" Hutchinson did not crash in 2012 - managing a top-six finish despite his problems - but came back with his leg in a 'horrendous' state. His tibia, weakened by infection, had bent in on itself by 26 degrees. And so it was under the knife again, as surgeon Krkovic cut out the section which they had grown from scratch and restarted the process. Back into the cage, which would not be removed until September 2013. More pain, more gain, and with a newly-grown left leg once more, Hutchinson had a turning point when he won at the 2013 Macau Grand Prix, a victory which gave belief to not only him, but also teams and sponsors, that he could be a winner again. Even then there was more disappointment as the 2014 season was written off, not through injury for once but a bike that Hutchinson could not get on with. But he was now fit to compete again - and in 2015 he finally ascended the mountain to win three races at the TT. \"Winning again felt amazing,\" he says. \"When I was coming up over the mountain knowing that I was going to win a TT I was thinking back to lying in a hospital bed in tatters, drugged out of my mind on morphine. \"All the work I'd gone through for that five years. I just thought 'I can't actually believe I'm going to win again'. It was really, really weird. The most emotional race ever.\" It was no fluke - a year later Hutchinson broke the lap record in practice and went on to win three more races. He was once again at the very top of his game. Hutchinson won two races at the 2017 TT to move to 16 wins overall and cement his place among the greatest road racers of all time. And then - the crash. He was battling for the lead of the Senior TT when he lost control of his BMW and ploughed into the side of the road. A year on, he still doesn't know why he crashed, with some images suggesting he may have had a puncture. After hitting the wall at over 100mph he was hit by his rebounding superbike, breaking his femur and smashing his ankle. How did he find the strength to move out of the way? \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         \"When you've been ridden over before you don't want it to happen again so I knew I had to get out of the road,\" he says. \"My leg was bent right out to the side, but I had to get out of the way, so I just dragged myself. The bikes would be coming in a few seconds and would be doing over 100mph there, which is pretty fast when you're sat on the floor. \"The first bike to come by was very close, if I hadn't have managed to move he would have hit me.\" High up on the mountain roads of the Isle of Man, Hutchinson was in agony. Luckily a helicopter with medics on board arrived within six minutes of his accident. \"Some people have said that I must have a high pain threshold but it does hurt, it's not like I can't feel it!\" he says. \"But there's no point in complaining or crying, it's not going to fix anything so just deal with it. \"When the medics came I kept saying 'I need ketamine, I need ketamine'. Eventually I passed out.\" When he awoke in hospital in Liverpool there was a further surprise. \"When I came back from theatre my femur was the same as when I went in. They said we've never seen a bone smashed as bad and we don't know what to do. \"I said 'this is it this time, it's not fixable'. It didn't look like a bone any more, just fragments.\" But after a phone call to Krkovic, Hutchinson had his femur plated and was transferred down to his old surgeon and friend, who set about cutting into his left tibia once again. Because Krkovic had to remove the talus bone from inside Hutchinson's ankle - which had lost all blood supply in the accident and would subsequently die - his tibia had to be broken artificially so that it could be lengthened to make up the shortfall. With Hutchinson also losing some of his femur in the crash, it means that his knees are now not at the same level.  After years of surgery and pain, did he consider retirement this time? What do you think? \"As soon as I came round, I knew I wanted to make it back for the TT in 2018. That's all I was bothered about,\" he said. \"If I wasn't winning races then I wouldn't have pushed to get back. It's not racing that's addictive, it's success. \"I have won the same amount of TTs after my accident in 2010 as I had before. I haven't forgotten how to ride fast. I've been more successful on my comeback than I was before. It makes me know that I can do it again this time.\" And so for the last year Hutchinson has battled through his familiar world of rehab and surgery, slowly growing bone in his same scarred left leg and edging closer to fitness week by week with a punishing, lonely gym schedule. There was still time for one more dice with death, though, as on two occasions Hutchinson was hit by massive blood clots in his lungs. \"Your femur holds a lot of blood so when you break it, it quite often forms a clot which can go into your heart and lungs.  \"They were so painful, it's like being stabbed. Bang, all of a sudden it's like a knife going in. Your lungs collapse. \"I was home alone the second time and it took an hour for the ambulance to come - I thought I was going to die.\" But the great survivor is back on a bike. He had his latest cage removed last month and was able to race at the North West 200 just a matter of days later. He will again be one of the star names on display at the TT this week. It's been quite the journey, but despite all his lows, Hutchinson is hoping for more highs to come.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45476430", "content": "It is October 2011 and 15-year-old George Green is travelling to London for a trial with Tottenham Hotspur when a phone call changes everything. Everton have agreed a \u00a32m deal with Bradford City for the schoolboy midfielder. Green signs a two-and-a-half-year contract, receives a \u00a345,000 signing-on fee in three instalments of \u00a315,000, and a promising future with the Toffees beckons for the Dewsbury teenager. Four years later he is standing on railway tracks near his hometown waiting for the next train so that he can end his life, Green's hopes of making it as a Premier League player ruined by cocaine and alcohol. \"I was in that much debt, I thought I'd lost my partner because of my drug use, and I didn't see a way back for me with football,\" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport. Now at sixth-tier Chester, who beat City of Liverpool 4-0 in the FA Cup second qualifying round on Saturday, Green opens up about having too much too soon, self-destruction, depression and how he is attempting to rebuild his life. \"Mental health and addiction is an everyday battle. I'm giving it my best shot,\" he says. \"If others can learn from it, I'd rather help.\" It was Everton Under-21s boss David Unsworth who broke the news to a tearful Green, then aged 19, he was no longer required after a loan at League Two Tranmere Rovers in 2015. He had arrived at Goodison Park a fresh-faced schoolboy and was quickly compared to Wayne Rooney, who made his senior debut for the club aged 16. Green left without playing a first-team game having spent five weeks of his four years at Goodison Park in London's Priory hospital, which provides a range of mental health and addictions treatments. \"Everton paid for it all, I think it was about \u00a35,000-a-week,\" said Green, who was playing in the Toffees' U21 side by the age of 16 alongside future England internationals John Stones and Ross Barkley. \"Before I turned 18 you wouldn't catch me out at night. As soon as I was 18 it was like a new world opened up. I was drinking, doing drugs and playing football. \"The first time I took drugs I'd gone to watch football in a pub with mates. I was offered cocaine and it changed my life.\" At first Green was able to hide his habit from the likes of Kevin Sheedy, his youth-team coach, but before long he was taking 30 grams a month and life was spiralling out of control. \"I was spending way over \u00a32,000 a month. I remember one particular Monday morning I was supposed to be training. I didn't wake up until the afternoon. \"The night before I'd gone to a friend's house for drink and drugs. I think that's when alarm bells started ringing at Everton. \"I remember phoning a welfare officer at Everton one night. I was crying and said 'I need help'. Soon after I was admitted to the Priory.\" Having joined Everton as a \u00a3150-a-week schoolboy, Green's earnings reached \u00a3110,000-a-year at the Premier League club. Since leaving three years ago, he has also had spells with Burnley and Oldham Athletic - as well as Viking in Norway's top flight under Englishman Ian Burchnall, now boss at Swedish side Ostersunds. Green, who has also featured in the Scottish Premiership for Kilmarnock, believes he has earned at least \u00a3500,000 playing football. \"I have an iPad to show for it. That's how much of a downfall my life has become because of drugs,\" he added. \"I squandered it all. I'm embarrassed.\" At Everton, the former England youth international did most of his socialising back home in Yorkshire.  \"A good night out? I'd easily spend about \u00a31,500. A meal would cost between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300,\" he said. \"I'd be like 'let's get a bottle of champagne' and then a girl would come and sit next to me and I'd be like 'would you like a bottle of champagne?' \"Earning the money I was, I thought it was never going to end.  \"Everybody wanted to know who I was and I was enjoying life. But I never got introduced to people who would keep me on the straight and narrow. They drank or did drugs and I fell into that circle. \"I got a brand new Mercedes-Benz A-Class and did about \u00a34,000 damage to it. That stemmed from drink-driving. I was ridiculous, I used to drink-drive everywhere.\" Green had four clubs within 14 months of leaving Everton. Soon after his release from the Toffees, he joined League One Oldham on a two-year deal. He lasted five months before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in November 2015. \"It was due to drink and drugs, I'd fallen out of love with the game and decided I didn't want to play any more.\" By now, Green was on a downward spiral. He had a drink-driving conviction and, after blowing much of his earnings on alcohol and cocaine, he was struggling financially. In addition, he was suffering from depression.  He did not stay away from football for long. A week after leaving Oldham, Green had signed for non-league Yorkshire side Ossett Albion for \u00a380-a-game. He had gone from Everton to the eighth tier of English football in less than six months. It was around this time he first contemplated suicide.  \"Leaving Everton hit me hard,\" he said. \"I was stood on a railway track close to Mirfield station near Dewsbury ready for a train to come. I remember it being around eight or nine o'clock at night.  \"I hadn't written a note. It was all the pressures of everything in my life. The drugs, the alcohol, my mental health, football wasn't going well, lack of money. \"Then there was an announcement over the speakers that the next train was delayed. \"I thought 'it must be a sign that it can't be my time to go'. I broke down in tears and walked away.\" Green's mental health problems continued. He took an overdose after joining Salford City on loan from Burnley in early 2017. \"I went in the pill cupboard at home and took everything there was. I wanted to die at that time,\" he added.  Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Salford's co-owner, offered his support. Green said: \"I was invited round to his house. I had been in hospital for taking too many tablets. We spoke for an hour about football and things Salford could do to help me.\" He lives near Dewsbury with his two-year-old daughter Daisy and fiancee, Charli, while the couple are due to welcome a baby boy to the family in October. Gone are the flash cars and the hangers-on who formed part of his life when he was at Everton. Instead of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Green now drives a Kia Rio to and from Chester, the club he joined in July from National League North rivals Nuneaton. Money is tight but the player blames no-one but himself. He relapsed in April but says he has not touched drink or drugs since, and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous meetings.  Green's support network includes former Aston Villa and England defender Gary Charles, a recovering alcoholic who now has a business which provides care to people who are experiencing a wide range of problems, including depression and alcohol/drug dependency. \"There's not a day I don't speak to him. He's a lifesaver,\" adds Green. At the time of this interview, Green has an additional battle in his life. Two months after signing, he has yet to make his Chester debut because of a back injury which is likely to require surgery. He's frustrated and impatient.  He has kept himself busy by getting to know Chester fans at home games, signing autographs and posing for pictures. Chester, a fan-owned club with a community trust, run a weekly mental health and wellbeing session which offers vulnerable members of society a chance to get out and play football. Green hopes opening up about his problems will raise awareness of mental health and addiction issues. \"Football is the only thing I am good at. Without it I'd be dead,\" he added. \"I thought my career would be over if I came out and started talking about my issues with drugs.  \"Then I said to myself 'how about being honest for once in your life and admit your problems'. \"If my story helps one person, I'm happy to tell it. I'm happier, healthier and way more positive than I was.\" If you have been affected by any of the issues discussed in this article, advice and support can be accessed here.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44360546", "content": "When Gareth Southgate was first put in charge of the England team, one national newspaper described the public reaction as a \"mass wail of despair\". After the debacle of losing to Iceland at Euro 2016 and the embarrassment of Sam Allardyce's tenure, England had turned to what looked to be the safe, corporate option. Not only that, Southgate's only previous senior managerial experience involved taking Middlesbrough down from the Premier League, then getting sacked. But he has barely put a foot wrong as he prepares to lead his country into Saturday's World Cup quarter-final with Sweden.  Qualification for Russia was achieved without alarm, the end of Wayne Rooney's international career was handled with kid gloves, and he has even guided England to a penalty shootout win. Clear-thinking, straight-talking and appearing to be a thoroughly decent bloke, Southgate has somehow got England to a World Cup quarter-final with optimism and realism in equal measure. Here, the people who know him best speak of the real Southgate. From being advised to become a travel agent, to throwing up over the Crystal Palace chairman, Euro '96 and beyond. Southgate, a boyhood Manchester United fan, attended Pound Hill Junior School and Hazelwick School, both in Crawley, Sussex. He has said both schools were \"fundamental\" in him taking up football, largely because of his PE teachers. Dave Palmer taught Southgate at Hazelwick. He was very self-assured. I remember the last chat I had with him as a schoolboy. We were talking about the future and I was asking the boys what they would be doing the following year.  Gareth said \"I'm at Crystal Palace\" and it dawned on me that was what he would be doing. As a 16-year-old, he was talking with absolute certainty.  In those days, 60-odd boys used to turn up for football trials when they joined the school. He stood out straight away because he was so classy and had so much time. He used to glide around the pitch. He was a multi-talented sportsman. He played rugby for the school, to the extent that when we went on a football and rugby tour to France, Gareth played both sports. He was quite quick, 200m was his best track event, but he also won the county championship and held the school record in the triple jump. He was mature, had a good a sense of humour and a big smile. He was respected by his peers and teachers. He was very thoughtful and clever, as well as having a sharp wit. He set himself him high expectations in everything he did, either in the classroom or on the sports field. There's always a discussion when someone has so many different talents about where they take their life. He could have taken an academic route, or a sporting route. So many boys I've known have had high hopes in football, but there's never any certainty. Gareth was sure he was on the right path. Southgate was released by Southampton as a youngster. He came to the attention of Palace youth-team manager Alan Smith, who would later make him captain of the first team. Even after they both left Palace, Southgate and Smith remained close. Southgate visited Smith within 24 hours of missing his Euro '96 penalty and later, when manager of Middlesbrough, took Smith to Teesside as an advisor. I had a doubt whether or not he had a career in professional football in him. We had one particular game, which we lost, and I called him into the office and said: \"Gareth, I think you're too bright to do this job. I think you have to make a choice. If it was my choice, I think you should become a travel agent.\" He was upset, but he took it on board. Instead of releasing him, I decided to go the other way and made him captain of the youth team, because I thought he had leadership qualities. Not because of what he said, but the way he went about his job. I introduced him to an estate agent friend of mine that got him to do some work after training. He was measuring up, mundane stuff, looking to see if a property could be marketed or not. All of these things help build the character that you become. It opened his eyes to what was out there and showed him what is was like to deal with people outside football. I was there when he threw up over the chairman, Ron Noades. It was a trip abroad and I had let the lads out for one night. Ron had his white shoes on and Gareth managed to do it. I heard plenty about it from Ron the next day. I can't repeat what Ron's words were, but I do know Gareth was very apologetic. No-one can say he has had it easy. He has had to fight for everything he has got, even if he did come from a middle-class Crawley background. To miss the penalty at Euro 1996, to be sacked by Middlesbrough, these are things that chip away from you. They have made him a stronger character. I know he went for one manager's job many years ago and he didn't get it because he was told he was too polite. He has principles. That does put him slightly aside from others. He has a real loyalty. He hasn't forgotten his roots. These are all things that make up his DNA that have led him to the England job. Southgate played every minute of England's Euro '96 campaign, which ended with his penalty miss against Germany. When he became England manager, he said he did not think he would ever have to go through a worse experience. Alan Shearer was part of the England team that night at Wembley. Not long ago, I made a documentary about Euro '96 and I asked Gareth if I could speak to him. He politely declined because he knew that one thing we wanted to talk about was the penalty miss and he'd had enough of it. Still to this day it will be hurting him. He took a penalty because he's brave. The manager was looking around for characters and one or two put their heads down, not wanting to take a penalty. That wasn't Gareth. After the five designated penalty takers were allotted, the manager was asking 'who's after that?' and Gareth stuck his hand up. I would never criticise anyone that has the courage, the balls, to put his hand up to take a penalty, particularly in those circumstances. When you have 90,000 in the stadium, 10 or 15 million watching on TV, it takes a certain character to put his hand up to take a penalty. There was nothing that I or anyone else could say to make him feel any better. Two years later we were at France '98. Tournaments can be a bit boring, doing the same thing for four or five weeks. We came up with the idea to fit as many song titles as possible into the interviews that we gave. Because the players' room was next door to the TV room and the interviews were going out live, once we got the song title in, you could hear a roar when the players realised you'd done it.  Gareth managed to sneak Club Tropicana and Careless Whispers into an interview with Bob Wilson. He was definitely one of the brighter ones, so he was better at that than most. He was certainly better at song titles than he was at taking penalties.  Southgate had caught the eye of Sven-Goran Eriksson when the Swede was manager of Lazio. When Eriksson became England manager in 2001, he had to manage Southgate's disappointment at falling behind the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell. Southgate was part of the England squad for the 2002 World Cup, but did not play a single minute. He won the last of his 57 caps against Sweden in 2004, two years before the end of Eriksson's spell in charge. He came to me and asked for a meeting. He wanted to know how to make himself better. That's not easy, to keep working, on and on to make yourself better than players like Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand. It's a little unusual. In my experience, players don't come to the manager. He wants to resolve problems with talks, more than with shouting. It was easy to speak to him. He was never angry or irritated, he was always very polite.  I could see that he was a thinking man. He thought about the training we did, why we did something in a certain way. You could see that he lived for football. He was very eager to learn and I wouldn't be surprised if at that time he was thinking of being a manager in the future. I have had many players who are not interested who the opponent is, they just want to play, but he was never the sort of player that did his training, then left without thinking about it. I'm quite sure he took it home with him. When you have players like that, you can see in the future they will be coaches or managers. When he was a player, he was already like a manager, a coach. I'm sure that Southgate, in the past, has talked to a lot of managers with a lot of experience, trying to find out secrets and advice. He is a good talker, but an even better listener. Southgate ended his playing career to become Middlesbrough manager in the summer of 2006. At 35, he was the youngest manager in the Premier League. He guided Boro to 12th and 13th over the following two seasons, but presided over their relegation in 2009. He was sacked on 21 October 2009, despite the club lying fourth in the Championship. Michael Caulfield was the Boro psychologist from soon after Southgate was appointed until they were relegated from the top flight. When he was still playing, his Boro team-mates nicknamed him 'Insurance'. George Boateng said whatever happened up the field, they knew they had Gareth behind them, ready to be used if needed, like an insurance policy. He went from being a player in the May to the manager in June, so the dynamic had to change. He understood he couldn't be their best mate, but the players knew he was of good character and he would treat them right. One day, I took him to see some cricket - Durham v Sussex in Chester-le-Street. It was a low-scoring game and we sat in the Sussex dressing room, watching their batsmen waiting to go in. He turned to me and said: \"I admire these athletes, because they have too much thinking time. How must it feel to watch wickets fall, knowing that you're next? That is so different to what footballers have to do.\" He spoke to them, wanting to know how they coped with it. He never stopped asking questions, trying to learn. Not once did he talk about himself. Gareth is brave. Not the physical bravery of leading your country into war, but the kind that means he will always front up.  In our last home game of the 2008-09 season, we had to beat Aston Villa otherwise it was pretty certain that we'd go down. We only drew 1-1. When the final whistle was greeted with boos and jeers, a lot of managers would have shaken hands then disappeared down the tunnel. Gareth marched into the centre circle to applaud the fans. Even though he wasn't being well received, he made sure he turned to all four corners of the ground. It was fight or flight and he never looked back. Southgate replaced Allardyce after one game of England's World Cup qualifying campaign in the autumn of 2016. They secured their place in Russia in October 2017 with a game to spare but then changed their system. Assistant manager Steve Holland has been with Southgate throughout his tenure as England boss. One of the things he identified on taking the job was there was an issue on the back of the Iceland defeat and previous tournaments. I'd be fair in saying the sum of the mass didn't quite balance with what it delivered. Why was that? Was it handling a pressure situation that left the players not delivering what they do for their clubs? He has gone about trying to change that. We have a link with the Marines that is beyond climbing up trees and running through mud, but how these guys drop into other countries in the middle of the night and handle the pressure of if they are one step out of the plan, they get shot. They know what really is pressure, how to handle that, and we have learned from that. In terms of watching England players in club football, I'm sure England staff in the past have been 100% committed, but it's impossible that any of them have watched more matches than we have done this year. The same is possible, maybe, but not more. If there's an early kick-off and a late on Saturday, we'll do two games. Regularly, there's Tuesday and Wednesday in the Champions League, then Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Every Monday morning, after a weekend of fixtures, we'll meet to discuss the games that we've watched.  We went to the Confederations Cup in the summer of 2017 and had the chance to discuss how England had been playing. We'd played a 4-2-3-1 formation in qualifying. We watched potential opponents - Germany played 3-4-3. We were looking at the opposition, trying to imagine where our team stood up against them.  We made some decisions that we felt would take the team to the next phase. We still had to qualify, so we didn't want to bring those changes in too early. Once we qualified, we had a game to spare, and we used that game to play with three centre-halves. That is what we have done ever since. A version of this feature was first published before the World Cup on 11 June 2018", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/45463018", "content": "Standing a few feet away from the Grand Slam trophy which she had just won, Naomi Osaka started crying. The 20-year-old Japanese had just beaten her childhood idol Serena Williams, bidding for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title and her first since giving birth, in the US Open final. Still wearing the black visor she had worn throughout the 6-2 6-4 victory, Osaka - the first player from Japan to win a major tournament - pulled it down over her face to cover the emotion. During what should have been the happiest moment of her career, they did not seem to be tears of joy. Boos rang around Arthur Ashe Stadium - not directed her, but at a sense of injustice felt by most of the 24,000 crowd against American superstar Williams. \"I felt bad at one point because I'm crying and she's crying. You know, she just won,\" said former world number one Williams, 36. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said on BBC Radio 5 live: \"This was the most bizarre match and presentation I have ever seen.\" So, how did it get to that point? \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         From the moment an image of Williams emerging from the locker room appeared on the big screen there was an expectant, partisan atmosphere inside Ashe. Serena might be a global superstar but more pertinently she is an American idol: appearing on television commercials, plastered across huge billboards on New York's Fifth Avenue. Tell anyone you meet in the city that you're here to cover the US Open and it brings up one topic: Serena. \"You've watched Serena? Wow, that's so cool. I'm not really into tennis but I love Serena.\" They love her. So, as her mind started to unravel and the match quickly followed, it was unsurprising to hear the mood of the New York crowd turn. Murmurs of dissent were first heard when Williams, who had already lost the first set at Flushing Meadows, was given a code violation at 2-1 in the second after chair umpire Carlos Ramos ruled that her coach Patrick Mouratoglou was signalling tactics from the stands - which is not allowed. Williams was seriously irked. \"We don't have any code,\" she told the Portuguese. \"I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose.\" After the match, Mouratoglou admitted in a television interview he had been coaching - but added \"I don't think she looked at me\" and \"everybody does it\". If the pair do not have a code, as Williams says, and if she did not see him make any signals, then she has a right to feel aggrieved - but with her coach, not the rule book. The United States Tennis Association, which runs the tournament, issued a statement later on Saturday backing Ramos. It said he acted \"in accordance to the rules\". While Williams says she wants to \"clarify\" what Mouratoglou was thinking and saying, the Frenchman cannot be blamed for her anger escalating. The Ashe crowd has often sensed when Williams needs their backing the most, with huge roars when she trailed 30-0 on serve at key moments against Karolina Pliskova and Anastasija Sevastova helping her turn those games around on the way to victories earlier in the tournament. Again they showed their support as Williams, now pumped and finding her shots, broke Osaka's serve for the only time in the match in the fourth game. But when Williams lost her serve in the following game, the mood changed completely. First, the American smashed her racquet, and when Ramos gave her another violation - again a correct one - she exploded. \"I didn't get coaching. You need to make an announcement that I don't cheat. You owe me an apology,\" she told the umpire. \"I have never cheated in my life. I have a daughter and I stand for what's right for her. I have never cheated.\" By now Ramos was getting the sort of treatment reserved for a pantomime villain. From that point it was a matter of when, not if, Osaka went on to clinch victory. She broke serve again for a 4-3 lead and then more drama unfolded when Williams continued to rant at Ramos. \"You stole a point from me. You are a thief,\" the 36-year-old said. That earned Williams a third violation for verbal abuse, Ramos announcing he had penalised her a game as a sense of confusion and disbelief swept around the stadium. An emotional Williams remonstrated further with Ramos and called for the tournament referee in what was rapidly becoming a chaotic situation. Those pantomime boos quickly turned more menacing, however. Loud jeers rained down on to the court. Some spectators were on their feet, some had their thumbs pointing down, and some shouted abuse at the Portuguese umpire. Osaka, somehow, maintained her cool. \"I didn't really hear anything because I had my back turned,\" she said. On all three counts, Ramos correctly penalised Williams by the letter of the law. According to ITF Grand Slam rules: However, Chris Evert, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion, said Ramos should have used common sense. \"Because of the big occasion - finals, the score, a game penalty - he should have warned her,\" the American told BBC Radio 5 live. \"Scold her. 'Ms Williams you need to be quiet because if you keep going on like this it will be a game.' \"Because of the enormity of the moment he should have given her a little bit of a break - but instead he just went right for the jugular.\" Ramos was not the only one going \"for the jugular\" - so did Osaka. Although Williams held to love immediately after the game penalty, the Japanese 20th seed maintained the composure she had showed from the start to take her second match point. That was the moment Osaka, who was brought up in New York after her family moved over from Japan, had dreamed of since picking up a racquet - beating her idol in a Grand Slam final. \"When I hugged Serena at the net I felt like a little kid again,\" said Osaka, who later revealed she made a school report on Williams in third grade. Still it felt like it was not the special moment it should have been. Boos continued to be heard at the end of the match and again when the presentation began. Osaka began to cry - a heart-wrenching moment which was hard to watch. That's when Williams, 16 years older than her opponent, intervened as her maternal instinct kicked in. \"Let's not boo any more,\" she pleaded. \"Congratulations Naomi. No more booing.\" The crowd responded and the jeers turned to cheers as Osaka took the microphone. \"I know everyone was cheering for her and I am sorry it has to end like this,\" she said. Humility and a sweet innocence off the court, but explosive hitting and steeliness on it, one imagines Osaka will have more Grand Slam victories to savour in the future. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: \"This must be the most surreal experience. A worthy champion but sadly for her it will be remembered for a very, very different story.\" Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash on BBC Radio 5 live: \"This was the most bizarre match and presentation I have ever seen.\" Former US Open champion Andy Roddick: \"Common sense should've prevailed in my opinion. He's within his power to make that call. I've seen an umpire borderline coach a player up, and another dock a game for being called a thief in same tourney.

Riccardo Saponara thought he had taken a point, but the goal was ruled out. Cristiano Ronaldo scored early on, and later put his side back in front with a penalty that was awarded for a handball which did not look deliberate. Samp's equaliser came from a penalty awarded after consultation with VAR. Former Juve striker Fabio Quagliarella hammered home the spot-kick after referee Paolo Valeri took instruction from his assistant following Emre Can's handball from a corner. Elsewhere, 10-man AC Milan scored for the first time in five league games to complete a comeback victory over SPAL. Andrea Petagna gave the struggling visitors a 13th-minute lead at the San Siro, but Samu Castillejo equalised three minutes later before Gonzalo Higuain completed the scoring in the second half.

Spurs led through Harry Kane's spectacular 25-yard strike in the first half but Wolves punished a poor second-half performance, scoring three times in the final 18 minutes to end their hosts' five-game winning run. The north London side would have moved only three points behind leaders Liverpool with a win, but the defeat and the Reds' 5-1 win over Arsenal means the Merseyside club ended the day nine points clear. \"We have had a very good run in the last few weeks and to keep that level is difficult,\" said Pochettino, whose side won 6-2 and 5-0 against Everton and Bournemouth respectively in their last two games. \"We tried to play a little more in the second half, but we were too direct and I think we started to pay for the effort in the other games.  \"We are not machines. We need to understand that we cannot get ourselves in this situation.\" Willy Boly brought the visitors level with a powerful header in the 72nd minute and Raul Jimenez then beat Hugo Lloris with a weak effort from the edge of the area to put Wolves in front. Helder Costa added a third on the counter-attack three minutes from time. Spurs, who did not have a single shot in the second half, remain second in the table but Manchester City can go back above them when they visit Southampton on Sunday. Spurs' performance in the second half was in a stark contrast to their previous two games, when they scored 11 goals. That free-scoring form had led manager Pochettino to admit his side were \"intruders\" in the title race, but a fifth league defeat of the season halts the momentum they had built. The north London side played well in the first half and had 10 efforts on goal, though most - including Kane's goal - came from distance. Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min were particularly lively. But after the break they were flat and lacked cohesion, the influence of Kane, Son and Eriksen diminished, and the introduction of Lucas Moura failed to spark them into life. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The tension inside Wembley increased as the home support witnessed their team lose control of the game as Wolves, who had barely threatened in the first half, grew in confidence. After Boly's deserved equaliser, the Spurs fans tried to squeeze more from their team but it was Wolves, helped by some slack defending, who created all of the chances late on. \"We did not dominate the ball in the second half,\" Pochettino said.  \"We were wrong in the way we tried to play, too much long ball and our energy dropped in the second half.\" Wolves' fans, players and manager Nuno Espirito Santo celebrated wildly at full-time. They did not create chances in the opening 45 minutes but, unlike Everton and Bournemouth before them, defended well enough to stay in the game. Then, when Spurs' performance dipped, they began to exert control on the game and Nuno made the right substitutions. Joao Moutinho was introduced to the base of midfield in the 68th minute and dictated play, as well as providing the pin-point cross from the set-piece for Boly's equaliser. Striker Costa, meanwhile, came on in the 59th minute and made an excellent run before a clinical low finish to seal the game with Wolves' third goal. Victory means they jump to seventh in the table, one place and three points behind Manchester United. They began 2018 as a promotion-chasing Championship side but end it as a team in the top half of the Premier League with a famous win over a title contender. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         \"It is good for the dressing room but to play like this at Wembley - the home of football - is the big thing,\" Nuno said. \"We have achieved something very special in getting to the Premier League and it has been a very special year. \"The second half was really really good. We managed possession, had chances and goals. \"We had a lot of belief after the equaliser - I would have said a draw was a good result, but I cannot control the emotions of the boys if they see space in front of them.\" Tottenham's next game is on New Year's Day at Cardiff (17:30 GMT).

Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said a no-deal exit would threaten access to EU-wide criminal databases and make it harder to extradite people from abroad. She told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed. Parliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it. The prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc. After Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects. The agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.  Please upgrade your browser The priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome. Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit. While she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\". \"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can. \"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\" A no deal Brexit could \"put the public at risk\" because of reduced security collaboration with the EU, says Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick #r4today https://t.co/v9XVVpWbcm pic.twitter.com/mABJ3J6ojW End of Twitter post  by @BBCr4today The Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit. She also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary. \"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.  \"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\" Ms Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU. But campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.  The organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.  \"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.  The Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.  \"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this. In the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers. She said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".  The authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working out what had happened and there would have to be much closer working between the private sector and the military to ensure there was no repeat.

The review of the higher tariff is a request from President Donald Trump, who wants China to change its trade practices. However, the decision risks escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies. China has already warned it would retaliate if the US went ahead with the plan, accusing Washington of blackmail. \"If the US side takes steps to further escalate the situation, we will definitely take countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our legitimate and legal rights and interests,\" said foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang on Wednesday.  The White House says the tariffs are a response to China's unfair trade policies, which Mr Trump blames for helping to create a huge trade deficit. A first round of tariffs came into effect on 6 July, when the US imposed 25% taxes on $34bn of Chinese imports. China retaliated in kind. Tariffs on another $16bn of products are pending, the second part of tariffs on $50bn worth of imports that the US announced in March. US threats have escalated since, with the President saying he is ready to impose tariffs on all $500bn of Chinese imports. In July, the US published a list of $200bn worth of additional products to be hit with tariffs of 10% - a figure the US is now considering raising to 25%. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said: \"The increase in the possible rate of the additional duty is intended to provide the administration with additional options to encourage China to change its harmful policies and behaviour and adopt policies that will lead to fairer markets and prosperity for all of our citizens.\"   The list named more than 6,000 items worth $200bn in annual trade, including chemicals, textiles, minerals and consumer goods ranging from baseball gloves to frozen fish fillets. Before the tariffs go into effect, they are subject to a public comment period. The duties could take effect as soon as September. Some US politicians expressed support for the White House move. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted \"the only way to remove barriers is to demonstrate to [China] our willingness to retaliate with barriers\". But other groups condemned the idea, saying the taxes would ultimately raise costs for US households and businesses. \"China's trade abuses need to be addressed, but tariffs are not the answer,\" the National Retail Federation said. The White House may hope that higher stakes force China to make concessions, but that is a risky bet, said Mickey Kantor, a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown who served as US commerce secretary under former president Bill Clinton. \"I don't think you can intimidate the Chinese into doing something they don't want to do,\" he told the BBC. The decision to turn to tariffs, instead of working with allies to negotiate, is undermining respect for international trade rules, he added. \"We're going to have globalisation whether some people like it or not .... The only question is, are we going to have any rules that apply,\" he said.

US President Donald Trump had been complaining about China's trading practices even before he took office in 2016.  That year he said China engaged in the \"rape\" of the US economy, and since then he has aggressively targeted Beijing as part of his broader America First agenda.  In 2017, the  US launched an investigation into Chinese trade policies and has steadily imposed tariffs on Chinese products from this year.  So far, the US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods, totalling more than $250bn (\u00a3191.9bn). They cover a wide range of consumer and industrial items including handbags, rice and  railway equipment. The duties range from 10% to 25%. Mr Trump has since threatened to hit another $267bn worth of goods - meaning all Chinese imports could be subject to tariffs.  The US has also put tariffs on worldwide imports of goods like steel and washing machines, which further affects products from China. Beijing has struck back. It's accused the US of starting \"the largest trade war in economic history\" and imposed tariffs on $110bn worth of American goods.  China's list of products subject to levies - which range from 5% to 25% - includes chemicals, coal and medical equipment. The moves have been strategic, targeting products made in Republican districts, and goods - like soybeans - that can be purchased elsewhere. Tariffs, in theory, make US-made products cheaper than imported ones, and encourage consumers to buy American. Already there are signs of economic strain.  Both US and international firms have said they are being harmed.  The IMF warned a full-blown trade war would weaken the global economy.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45011587", "content": "New trade tariffs are raising costs for US businesses, testing their power to pass on the expenses to consumers.  US equipment maker Caterpillar on Monday said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. But while higher prices are shielding some firms, others are under strain. On the same day, food processor Tyson Foods cut its profit forecast, saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.70-$6 for its 2018 financial year due to a surplus in US supply caused by the tariffs. That was down from its earlier $6.55-$6.70 forecast. Lower prices for beef and pork have also reduced demand for chicken, the firm added. \"The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,\" said Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods president and chief executive officer.  The updates were the latest from businesses explaining how trade disputes are raising costs and shifting demand for products that range from cars to beer. In March, the US announced tariffs on steel and aluminium, prompting China, the European Union, Mexico and other places to retaliate with import taxes on US products such as pork, wine and whiskey. Separately, the US and China have also imposed tit-for-tat tariffs of $34bn on the other country's goods, in a row over intellectual property practices and state subsidies. While some firms, including Caterpillar, have said they will pass on higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, others are more constrained. BMW, for example, has said it would raise prices in China by 4%-7% on two SUV models, which are US-made. But the rise will not completely absorb the cost of China's new taxes on US vehicles, the firm warned. Harley Davidson told investors it plans to shoulder the cost of European tariffs on US-made motorcycles in order to remain competitive. It is also grappling with higher steel and aluminium prices. Overall, analysts expect the duties to have a relatively modest impact. Analysts at US bank Wells Fargo estimate that the US tariffs so far will boost inflation in the US by 0.1%, but said that the rise could be softened by price declines for products targeted by other countries for retaliation. The changes come as higher fuel and labour costs fuel stronger inflation in the US. The index for producer prices climbed 3.4% over the 12 months to July, the strongest annual gain since November 2011, according to figures from the US Labor Department. The consumer price index increased 2.9% over the 12 months to June.

But as always - the devil is in the detail - and truth be told, there's not much detail when it comes to this deal.  So let's unpick their agreement. This was a deal that both sides needed to play well at home.  Which is why it was interesting that the first inkling we had of an agreement actually came from Chinese media.  Both China Daily and Chinese international broadcaster CGTN said that President Trump and President Xi had agreed not to impose new tariffs after 1 January.  President Xi has been grappling with a slowing economy at home, and analysts say he's been under pressure to come home with some sort of a deal that wouldn't exert more pain on Chinese manufacturers. There's some evidence that companies in China are seeing some pain because of the trade war, but for now, at the 10% level, it's been manageable. A 25% increase would change things dramatically.  Ditto for President Trump. US lobby groups have pressed him to put aside differences with China and pointed out that higher tariffs would mean higher costs for American manufacturers - which would in turn lead to higher prices for US consumers.  He's publicly brushed aside those concerns before, but this deal will help him look strong back home, whilst also granting US companies more time to figure out what to do if the next set of tariffs do come into effect. The US, at first glance, does come out better in this deal.  President Trump has managed to get China to agree to talk about some key problems his administration has with the way Beijing does business - and an agreement to get China to buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and industrial goods from the US.  There's also the Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors deal - an unwitting victim of the trade war -  that President Xi said he \"is open to\" approving, after Beijing failed to approve the merger earlier this year.  Analysts say we could see a possible approval on that front if the talks over the next 12 weeks go well. President Trump also praised China on North Korea - a key part of his relationship with President Xi, and that the two will work towards a nuclear free Korean peninsula.  But China has also ensured that the language of this agreement is vague, and non binding - which means it is not clear at all how much Beijing has to open up, or how much it will buy from the US. This is a key part of the agreement. China and the US have agreed to immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft, services and agriculture - within the next 90 days.  If they cannot reach an agreement, the 10% tariffs will be raised up to 25%. This deadline takes us past the Chinese New Year holiday, and basically buys both sides more time.  The US wants China to give up forced technology transfers and give American firms more access to the Chinese market.  Whether China has the same definition of what that means, will be the key gauge of whether their talks are successful. But things are changing in Beijing, at least according to an editorial in the Global Times, often seen as a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.  In today's edition, commenting on the Xi-Trump truce, it says \"Any decision that benefits China's development is right.\"  Perhaps from a position of self-interest, this temporary reprieve is worth sacrificing for.  How much China will sacrifice though, will be key to whether this deal is anything more than just a temporary truce, or a long-lasting definitive re-writing of the US-China relationship. Interestingly the 90 day timeline doesn't appear to get much of a mention in Chinese media - which may be trying to spin this as a complete victory for President Xi, rather than what it is: a temporary truce for the Christmas holidays.  No more tit-for-tat tweets, or tariff threats - for now at least.  But without real specifics, and some serious giving in from China, it is hard to see that we won't be back at this position in three months' time.  And next time - it will be for real - and not just on trade.  There are already rumblings in the Trump White House of restricting visas to Chinese academics and students. This reprieve may be a welcome respite from the antagonism of recent months - but if the two sides don't come to a credible and substantive deal - things could be much worse in the future.

He said de-listing from the stock exchange meant Tesla, currently valued at $63.8bn (\u00a350bn), would no longer be under the glare of Wall Street.  In an unusual move, Mr Musk first made the announcement on Twitter rather than via an official regulatory disclosure. But analysts are sceptical about what would be the biggest buyout in history.  Since Tesla floated on the stock market, Mr Musk has clashed with analysts and complained that quarterly scrutiny of the firm's finances encourages short-term thinking. Tesla shares ended the day 11% up at almost $380 per share - close to their all-time high. Mr Musk said shareholders would be offered $420 per share, valuing the business at more than $80bn, including debt. A buyout at that value would make it by far the biggest such deal. The current biggest is the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium that included KKR and TPG. Mr Musk claimed to have secured funding to buy out shareholders, but did not provide details. However, he also warned that \"a final decision has not been made\" about the move. Any buy-out would need a shareholder vote. BBC business editor Simon Jack said that if it emerges that Mr Musk did not have solid financial backing for a buyout he could be in trouble with regulators for share price manipulation. While Twitter was an unconventional way to make the announcement, the US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, allows firms to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter in this way provided investors have been told which social media outlets will be used. In 2013, Tesla flagged Mr Musk's Twitter account as a source of information.  The firm subsequently shared a message from Mr Musk to employees that explained the thinking behind his announcement.  Mr Musk, who owns almost 20% of the company, said he hoped the move would shield the firm from distracting swings in the share price and the pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. He also said he wanted to end \"negative propaganda\" from short sellers, investors who bet on the shares of a firm going down. \"Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,\" he wrote. Mr Musk has discussed the drawbacks of being a public company before. But his tweets stirred confusion initially, given his history of informal use of the social media service. For example, on April Fool's Day, he joked on Twitter about Tesla going bankrupt.  Mr Musk's plan would allow investors to choose to retain their holdings. He planned to hold onto his shares and hoped to continue as chief executive, he added.  Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, said Mr Musk had a \"one-in-three chance\" of managing to succeed with his plan. \"The 16% premium to the current share price may not be high enough to incentivise existing shareholders to support the sale,\" he added.  And Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise finance when Tesla has still not made a profit.  \"The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?\" he said. Elon Musk had better have the money lined up to take Tesla private or he could be in serious trouble with regulators. There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each. The shares surged, which will have left the people who have been betting the shares would fall nursing very heavy losses. It will have given Mr Musk great pleasure to get one over on the naysayers. But he's playing a potentially dangerous game. If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation. It's a very serious charge, which can land you in jail. Read Simon's blog. Mr Musk's disclosure stirred further speculation about Tesla's future. The firm is spending heavily as it ramps up production of its latest car, the Model 3. It reported a record loss in its most recent quarter, and some analysts say it will need to raise money in order to survive. However, Mr Musk has said he has no plans to do so and promised that the firm will be profitable in the second half of the year, barring any unforeseen events. The tweets came after a separate report in the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had taken a 3%-5% stake in Tesla, a holding worth at least $1.9bn. The article said the state fund, overseen by the powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been interested in buying newly issued shares.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46135276", "content": "Tesla has named an Australian executive as its new chairman after Elon Musk was forced to give up the role. Robyn Denholm, the finance chief of Australian telecoms firm Telstra, takes over from the electric car maker's founder, who remains chief executive. Mr Musk agreed to step down as chair last month to resolve claims of fraud brought by US financial regulators.  The settlement requires Tesla to install an independent chairman, among other penalties. The announcement scotches reports that James Murdoch was the frontrunner for the job. Tesla has endured a difficult few months, following comments Mr Musk made on social media in early August suggesting he had \"funding secured\" for a deal to take Tesla private.  Its shares soared following his comments but weeks later Mr Musk backed away from the plan, blaming feedback from shareholders. US authorities sued the entrepreneur for misleading investors and he and Tesla were each fined $20m. Mr Musk was also obliged to relinquish his role as chairman for three years. Investors had also called for stronger oversight of Mr Musk after his erratic behaviour attracted attention. In media interviews he said he often slept on a sofa in the Tesla office and more recently in an online video he briefly smoked marijuana. Tesla, which has never reported an annual profit, also came under strain over production schedules for its Model 3 electric car, its newest car aimed at a wider market. However, the carmaker made what Mr Musk called an \"historic\" profit in the most recent quarter. Ms Denholm, who has been on Tesla's board since August 2014, became Telstra CFO in July.

It follows a statement from BT earlier this month that it was swapping out the Chinese firm's kit from the \"core\" of its 3G and 4G mobile networks. The Sunday Telegraph was first to report the latest development. It said the move could extend work on the late-running \u00a32.3bn project. BT is covering the cost of the switch. It does not believe the changeover will lead to a further delay. The Emergency Services Network (ESN) was originally due to be completed by the end of 2019. At that point it was meant to replace an existing Motorola-owned radio system called Airwave, which is used by the police, fire and rescue, and ambulance services. The ESN is intended to give its users \"secure\" priority access to EE's 4G network, which is being extended via additional radio frequencies in rural areas and new mast sites. It should be cheaper to run than Airwave while also providing superior voice and data capabilities. But the effort is overrunning, and in September the Home Office announced that it would pay for use of Airwave until the end of 2022 with scope for a further extension if required. EE won the contract to roll out the ESN in 2015, a year before the network provider was acquired by BT. Since then, it has become subject to a BT policy that Huawei's kit should not be used at the core of its mobile networks to push customers' data about. Instead, BT limits the equipment to periphery parts such as phone mast antennas. \"We have ongoing plans to swap to a new core network vendor for ESN, in line with BT's network architecture principles established in 2006,\" a spokesman for EE told the BBC. \"This will be managed with no disruption to the ESN service.\" He added that it was still EE's intention to offer \"full capability\" of the system by 2020. BT has not been explicit about the reasons behind its policy.

It follows a statement from BT earlier this month that it was swapping out the Chinese firm's kit from the \"core\" of its 3G and 4G mobile networks. The Sunday Telegraph was first to report the latest development. It said the move could extend work on the late-running \u00a32.3bn project. BT is covering the cost of the switch. It does not believe the changeover will lead to a further delay. The Emergency Services Network (ESN) was originally due to be completed by the end of 2019. At that point it was meant to replace an existing Motorola-owned radio system called Airwave, which is used by the police, fire and rescue, and ambulance services. The ESN is intended to give its users \"secure\" priority access to EE's 4G network, which is being extended via additional radio frequencies in rural areas and new mast sites. It should be cheaper to run than Airwave while also providing superior voice and data capabilities. But the effort is overrunning, and in September the Home Office announced that it would pay for use of Airwave until the end of 2022 with scope for a further extension if required. EE won the contract to roll out the ESN in 2015, a year before the network provider was acquired by BT. Since then, it has become subject to a BT policy that Huawei's kit should not be used at the core of its mobile networks to push customers' data about. Instead, BT limits the equipment to periphery parts such as phone mast antennas. \"We have ongoing plans to swap to a new core network vendor for ESN, in line with BT's network architecture principles established in 2006,\" a spokesman for EE told the BBC. \"This will be managed with no disruption to the ESN service.\" He added that it was still EE's intention to offer \"full capability\" of the system by 2020. BT has not been explicit about the reasons behind its policy.

But after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right. The actress always said she was \"very bad at getting round to things\".  But from her early radio roles in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she made more than 1,300 appearances on radio and TV. June Rosemary Whitfield was born in Streatham, south London on 11 November 1925. Her father was a telephone company executive, her mother an amateur actress who pushed her young daughter into dramatics and dancing.  Trained at Rada, to which she attributed her hard work ethic, Whitfield took her first professional acting job in 1944.  She was soon in demand on stage, radio and later television, and her long and varied career made for some surprising connections.  When she appeared in the London production Ace of Clubs, she was befriended by the show's creator, Noel Coward, and spent weekends at his glamorous country home.  Later she joined the chorus line of South Pacific, with its American lead Mary Martin, dating the star's young son, a pre-Dallas Larry Hagman.  However, her husband of 46 years, Tim Aitchison, was not from the same industry, but a chartered surveyor. Whitfield's ability to conjure up characters and superb sense of comic timing kept her in demand from across the entire canon of British comedy.  Stars such as Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper all clamoured to work with her. She called her autobiography ...and June Whitfield, in recognition of the fact that she always got second billing. \"The greatest of show business mysteries,\" Denis Norden once said, \"was how anyone could contemplate doing a comedy show without June Whitfield.\" With Frankie Howerd, she recorded a version of the song Je T'aime, but even their spoof, complete with ironic heavy breathing, was considered too risque for the time and was famously banned by the BBC. Her most memorable radio role was in The Glums, Frank Muir and Denis Norden's spoof family soap, part of the popular show Take It From Here. For seven years as the long-suffering Eth, her most oft-heard line was the lamenting \"Ooh, Ron\", addressed to her hapless fiance.  And for two decades, she read the News Huddlines for her long-time friend and colleague Roy Hudd, in radio's longest-running audience comedy. Her first starring TV role came in the BBC sitcom Beggar My Neighbour in 1966. She went on to form her first working relationship with Terry Scott in Scott On..... before the pair teamed up again for Terry and June. The chemistry between the unflappable Whitfield and her hare-brained husband was so solid that many viewers believed they were married in real life.  Described as the apotheosis of undemanding, middle-class, primetime comedy, Terry and June attracted audiences of 15 million during its eight-year run. Whitfield described herself as living \"in the suburban corner, in real life and in the parts I've played. Very English, and nothing wrong with that\". She also became the face of a string of adverts for Birds Eye frozen ready meals with the punchline: \"It can make a dishonest woman of you.\" Her big screen appearances included four Carry On films, and, in 1996, the part of Aunt Drusilla in a film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure \"The Carry Ons were a nudging sort of humour, like seaside postcards,\" she said.  \"Not at all politically correct, which was always a good thing.\" In 1992, she became an unlikely icon to a new generation of fans with her portrayal of Edina's unworldly mother in the internationally successful Absolutely Fabulous.  Originally scheduled to appear in just one episode, she went on to become one of the show's most popular characters.  \"As Joanna Lumley says, Ab Fab made us born-again actresses,\" she commented.

It emerged this week that tech companies have been racing to fix the Meltdown and Spectre bugs, that could allow hackers to steal data. Billions of PCs, smartphones and tablets around the world are affected - Apple has now confirmed its products are too. The firm has released some patches to mitigate the Meltdown flaw. It said there was no evidence that either vulnerability had been exploited yet, but advised downloading software only from trusted sources to avoid \"malicious\" apps.   Mac users have often believed that their devices and operating systems are less vulnerable to security issues than, for example Android phones or computers running Microsoft systems.  The Meltdown and Spectre flaws are found in many modern computer processing units - or microchips - designed by Intel and ARM, and together the firms supply almost the entire global computer market. \"All Mac systems and iOS devices are affected, but there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time,\" Apple said in blog post on the issue. \"These issues apply to all modern processors and affect nearly all computing devices and operating systems.\"  Apple said it had already released \"mitigations\" against Meltdown in its latest iPhones and iPad operating system update - iOS 11.2  and the macOS 10.13.2 for its MacBooks and iMacs.  Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch, it said. Patches against Spectre, in the form of an update to web browser Safari, will be released \"in the coming days\". Google and Microsoft have already issued statements telling users which products are affected by the bugs. Google said its Android phones - which make up more than 80% of the global market - were protected if users had the latest security updates. And Microsoft has already released fixes for many of its services.  Windows users should be aware that third-party anti-virus software may need to be updated before applying operating system patches. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont is maintaining an online list of anti-virus products that have been updated. Guidance from US cyber-security project CERT, which is funded by the federal government, originally advised computer users that in order to fully remove the vulnerability they would have to \"replace\" processor hardware. It has now changed that advice to say users should \"apply updates\" to mitigate any attacks instead. As the severity of the microchip flaws affecting billions of devices became clear, news broke that Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich sold off 245,000 of his shares in the firm in October. This was at a time when Intel knew about Meltdown and Spectre, but before the issues had become public. \"Brian's sale is unrelated,\" said Intel in a statement.  \"It was made pursuant to a pre-arranged stock sale plan [...] with an automated sale schedule.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42905185", "content": "Pornographic videos that used new software to replace the original face of an actress with that of a celebrity are being deleted by a service that hosted much of the content. San Francisco-based Gfycat has said it thinks the clips are \"objectionable\". The creation of such videos has become more common after the release of a free tool earlier this month that made the process relatively simple. The developer says FakeApp has been downloaded more than 100,000 times. It works by using a machine-learning algorithm to create a computer-generated version of the subject's face.  To do this it requires several hundred photos of the celebrity in question for analysis and a video clip of the person whose features are to be replaced. The results - known as deepfakes - differ in quality. But in some cases, where the two people involved are of a similar build, they can be quite convincing. Some people have used the technology to create non-pornographic content. These include a video in which the face of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has been replaced with that of US President Donald Trump, and several in which one movie star's features have been swapped with those of another. End of Youtube post  by derpfakes But the most common use of the tool has apparently been to reversion pornography to feature popular female actresses and singers. Many of these clips have subsequently been shared online and critiqued by others. Many creators uploaded their clips to Gfycat. The service is commonly used to host short videos that are then posted to social website Reddit and elsewhere. Gfycat allows adult content, but began deleting some of the deepfakes earlier this week, a matter that was first reported by the news site Motherboard. \"Our terms of service allow us to remove content that we find objectionable. We are actively removing this content,\" Gfycat said in a brief statement. Reddit has yet to comment on the matter. It still provides access to clips that Gfycat has yet to delete, as well as deepfakes hosted by others. Its content policy prohibits \"involuntary pornography\".  But it is not clear whether it would recognise the deepfakes as such. Moreover, it requires the subject involved to make a complaint. However, Gfycat is not the only party to have forced some of the material offline. The owner to the rights of some of the explicit content has demanded that clips be blocked on copyright grounds. In addition, the chat service Discord closed down a group dedicated to sharing the clips, saying that they had violated its rules on non-consensual pornography.

The company is accused of using the personal data of 50 million Facebook members to influence the US presidential election in 2016. Its executives have also been filmed by Channel 4 News suggesting it could use honey traps and potentially bribery to discredit politicians. The company denies any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned to give evidence about the company's links to Cambridge Analytica to a UK parliamentary committee. Damian Collins MP, who is leading the committee's inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of giving answers \"misleading to the committee\" at a previous hearing which asked whether information had been taken without users' consent. On Monday, Channel 4 News broadcast hidden camera footage in which Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix appears to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.  In the footage, asked what \"deep digging\" could be done, Mr Nix told an undercover reporter: \"Oh, we do a lot more than that.\" He suggested one way to target an individual was to \"offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that's video recorded\". He also said he could \"send some girls around to the candidate's house...\" adding that Ukrainian girls \"are very beautiful, I find that works very well\". Mr Nix continued: \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done.\" Channel 4 News said its reporter had posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get a political candidate elected in Sri Lanka. However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had \"grossly misrepresented\" the conversations caught on camera. \"In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios,\" the company said in a statement. \"Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps',\" it said. Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he regarded the report as a \"misrepresentation of the facts\" and said he felt the firm had been \"deliberately entrapped\".  On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it can provide data and insights to \"drive your voters to the polls and win your campaign\" and says it has played a \"pivotal role\" in winning US presidential races.   UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is investigating the company over claims it used personal data to influence the US election. Christopher Wylie, who worked with the company, claimed it amassed the data of millions of people through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life that was created by an academic. Ms Denham demanded access to the firm's databases and servers after it missed her Monday deadline. She said her office has been investigating political campaigning and the use of political data for many months - the allegations against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica were one strand of that work. She said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in \"an unauthorised way\", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when they found out about the loss of the data. She admitted she told Facebook to withdraw from its own search of Cambridge Analytica's offices, saying there were concerns it might damage the integrity of her investigation. \"Our advice to Facebook was to back away - and they agreed,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Labour's shadow digital economy minister Liam Byrne said Ms Denham's powers did not allow her to apply for a digital search warrant \"quickly and quietly\". Instead, she has \"told the world she's going to court\", giving Cambridge Analytica and others time to hide any evidence, he told the Today programme. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said her legal powers were inadequate and this matter had highlighted a need for \"greater powers and greater sanctions\". Ms Denham said she was using all the powers she had under the law but would not know whether evidence had been tampered with until her team of forensic experts gained access to the offices. Cambridge Analytica insists it followed the correct procedures in obtaining and using data, but it was suspended from Facebook last week. Facebook, meanwhile, will hold an open meeting with its employees later to discuss the matter, tech news website The Verge is reporting. Facebook said it has hired its own digital forensic team to audit Cambridge Analytica to find out whether the Facebook data in question still exists. \"If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made.\" Facebook said Aleksandr Kogan, who created the personality app from which the data had been harvested, has agreed to be audited, but Mr Wylie - who made the claims about the way the data was gathered and used - has declined. There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. \"The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,\" said a spokeswoman. \"Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43649018", "content": "Facebook believes the data of up to 87 million people was improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica - many more than previously disclosed.  The BBC has been told that about 1.1 million of them are UK-based. The overall figure had been previously quoted as being 50 million by the whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said \"clearly we should have done more, and we will going forward\". During a press conference he said that he had previously assumed that if Facebook gave people tools, it was largely their responsibility to decide how to use them. But he added that it was \"wrong in retrospect\" to have had such a limited view. \"Today, given what we know... I think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility,\" he said. \"That we're not just building tools, but that we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well.\" Mr Zuckerberg also announced an internal audit had uncovered a fresh problem. Malicious actors had been abusing a feature that let users search for one another by typing in email addresses or phone numbers into Facebook's search box. As a result, many people's public profile information had been \"scraped\" and matched to the contact details, which had been obtained from elsewhere. Facebook has now blocked the facility. \"It is reasonable to expect that if you had that [default] setting turned on, that in the last several years someone has probably accessed your public information in this way,\" Mr Zuckerberg said. The estimates of how many people's data had been exposed were revealed in a blog by the tech firm's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer. The BBC has also learned that Facebook now estimates that about 305,000 people had installed the This Is Your Digital Life quiz that had made the data-harvesting possible. The previously suggested figure had been 270,000. About 97% of the installations occurred within the US. However, just over 16 million of the total number of users affected are thought to be from other countries. A spokeswoman for the UK's Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that it was continuing to assess and consider the evidence before deciding what steps to take. Facebook has faced intense criticism after it emerged that it had known for years that Cambridge Analytica had collected data from millions of its users, but had relied on the London-based firm to self-certify that it had deleted the information. Cambridge Analytica said it had bought the information from the creator of the This Is Your Digital Life app without knowing that it had been obtained improperly. The firm says it deleted all the data as soon as it was made aware of the circumstances. But Channel 4 News has since reported that at least some of the data in question is still in circulation despite Cambridge Analytica insisting it had destroyed the material. During Mr Zuckerberg's press conference, Cambridge Analytica tweeted it had only obtained data for 30 million individuals - not 87 million - from the app's creator, and again insisted it had deleted all records. Cambridge Analytica licensed data from GSR for 30 million individuals, not 87 million. We did not receive more than 30 million records from research company GSR. End of Twitter post  by @CamAnalytica The latest revelations came several hours after the US House Commerce Committee announced that Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before it on 11 April. Facebook's share price has dropped sharply in the weeks since the allegations emerged. In his Wednesday blog post, Mr Schroepfer detailed new steps being taken by Facebook in the wake of the scandal. They include: Facebook has also published proposed new versions of its terms of service and data use policy. The documents are longer than the existing editions in order to make the language clearer and more descriptive. Another change the company announced involved limiting the type of information that can be accessed by third-party applications. Immediately after the changes were announced, however, users of the widely popular dating app Tinder were hit by login errors, leaving them unable to use the service.  A technical issue is preventing users from logging into Tinder. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to have everyone swiping again soon. End of Twitter post  by @Tinder Tinder relies on Facebook to manage its logins. Users reported that they had been signed out of the app and were unable to log in again.

Mr Zuckerberg has declined to answer questions from British MPs. When asked about this by the BBC, he said he had decided that his chief technology officer and chief product officer should answer questions from countries other than the US. He added, however, that he had made a mistake in 2016 by dismissing the notion that fake news had influenced the US Presidential election. \"People will analyse the actual impact of this for a long time to come,\" he added. \"But what I think is clear at this point is that it was too flippant and I should never have referred to it as crazy.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44250597", "content": "Popular video game critic John Bain - known as TotalBiscuit and the Cynical Brit - has died aged 33.  He had 2.2 million YouTube subscribers, but retired from reviewing games in April after bowel cancer spread to his liver. In a lengthy post on Reddit, he wrote that he did not \"have long left\" and said that his cancer was terminal. After a tweet appeared on his official account confirming his passing, his wife Genna posted a poem as a tribute to her late husband. She wrote: \"I'm more overwhelmed with grief than I could possibly express\". Mr Bain rose to prominence in 2010 by uploading gameplay videos and reviews to his YouTube channel.  He was a champion of many smaller, indie titles, producing videos where he shared his first impressions of new titles. He also curated lists of game recommendations on the Steam store. Mr Bain was also an outspoken critic of many popular top-selling games. He said many developers sought to maximise profit at the expense of game play. Video service Twitch, where Mr Bain live-streamed gaming sessions, thanked him for his contribution to the industry. \"John Bain's opinionated game critiques and sense of humour led to him becoming one of the most prominent voices in the gaming industry,\" it said in a statement. Prominent gamers took to Twitter to share their tributes. Mr Bain first contracted bowel cancer in 2014 but under treatment the disease went into remission. However, the cancer returned and spread to his liver and spine.  \"Most people with these symptoms don't have bowel cancer. Other health problems can cause similar symptoms.

The data centre, a white cylinder containing computers, could sit on the sea floor for up to five years. An undersea cable brings the data centre power and takes its data to the shore and the wider internet - but if the computers onboard break, they cannot be repaired. Orkney was chosen because it is a major centre for renewable energy research. The theory is that the cost of cooling the computers will be cut by placing them underwater.  \"We think we actually get much better cooling underwater than on land,\" says Ben Cutler, who is in charge of what Microsoft has dubbed Project Natick.  \"Additionally because there are no people, we can take all the oxygen and most of the water vapour out of the atmosphere which reduces corrosion, which is a significant problem in data centres.\" It will not be possible to repair the computers if they fail, but the hope is that there will be a lower failure rate than on land.  This is a tiny data centre compared with the giant sheds that now store so much of the world's information, just 12 racks of servers but with enough room to store five million movies.  Microsoft's first experimental underwater data centre, sunk for five months in 2015, was dubbed Leona Philpot after a character in an XBox game.  If Project Natick proves a success, Microsoft envisages sinking groups of five of these cylinders and being able to deploy a data centre offshore in 90 days, whereas it could take years on land.  The operation to sink the Orkney data centre has been an expensive multinational affair.  The cylinder was built in France by a shipbuilding company, Naval, loaded with its servers and then sailed from Brittany to Stromness in Orkney. There, another partner, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), provided help including the undersea cable linking the centre to the shore. The presence of EMEC, with its expertise in renewable energy and its knowledge of the seas around Orkney, was one factor behind Microsoft's decision to choose this location. \"We've got so much renewable energy here,\" says EMEC managing director Neil Kermode. \"We've produced more than we need since 2012.\"  The Orkney Islands were early adopters of wind energy. And EMEC has been experimenting with tidal and wave energy for 14 years, with one of its test sites on the beach where the Project Natick cable comes ashore. There has been growing concern that the rapid expansion of the data centre industry could mean an explosion in energy use.  But Emma Fryer, who represents the sector at Tech UK, says that fear has been exaggerated.  \"What's happened is we've had the benefit of Moore's Law,\" she says.  The continued advances in processing power have made doom-laden predictions look foolish, Ms Fryer says. \"We've been able to deal with explosions of data with only a small increase in the energy used.\" Nevertheless, she accepts there is a challenge as the industry continues to expand and she welcomes experiments such as Microsoft's. \"It's really exciting that they are thinking this radically,\" she says. Ms Fryer also thinks situating data centres near to or under the sea is a good idea. She says: \"50% of the world's population live near the coast.\" Another expert is not so sure.  Prof Ian Bitterlin, a data centre consultant for nearly 30 years, is sceptical about the environmental impact of going underwater. \"You just end up with a warmer sea and bigger fish,\" he says.  And 90% of Europe's data centres are in big cities such as London and Madrid because that is where they are needed. Microsoft's Ben Cutler insists the warming effect will be minimal - \"the water just metres downstream would get a few thousandths of a degree warmer at most\" - and the overall environmental impact of the Orkney data centre will be positive. As we bobbed about on a boat just above the site where the data centre was to be sunk the following day, I put it to him that many people might think the whole venture was a bit crazy. \"This is a crazy experiment that I hope will turn into reality\" he said. \"But this is a research project right now - and one reason we do different types of research into data centres is to learn what makes sense before we decide to take it to a larger scale.\" Now, the Project Natick team will monitor the data centre for the next five years. It could turn out to be a signpost to the future - or maybe just a tourist attraction for passing fish.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44783779", "content": "PayPal wrote to a woman who had died of cancer saying her death had breached its rules and that it might take legal action as a consequence. The firm has since acknowledged that the letter was \"insensitive\", apologised to her widower, and begun an inquiry into how it came to be sent. The matter came to light after her bereaved husband contacted the BBC. He said he wanted to make other organisations aware how distressing automated messages could be. Lindsay Durdle died on 31 May aged 37.  She had been first diagnosed with breast cancer about a year-and-a-half earlier. The disease had later spread to her lungs and brain. PayPal was informed of Mrs Durdle's death three weeks ago by her husband Howard Durdle. He provided the online payments service with copies of her death certificate, her will and his ID, as requested. He has now received a letter addressed in her name, sent to his home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. It was headlined: \"Important: You should read this notice carefully.\" It said that Mrs Durdle owed the company about \u00a33,200 and went on to say: \"You are in breach of condition 15.4(c) of your agreement with PayPal Credit as we have received notice that you are deceased... this breach is not capable of remedy.\" PayPal has told Mr Durdle that it is looking into this \"as a priority\", and has written off the debt in the meantime. \"We apologise to Mr Durdle for the distress this letter has caused,\" a spokesman added. \"We are urgently looking into this matter, and are in direct contact with Mr Durdle to support him.\" Mr Durdle said a member of PayPal's staff had told him there were three possible explanations: He added that he had been assured that whatever the cause, it would be addressed, although PayPal had told him it would not be able to share the information because it was an \"internal matter\". \"I'm in a reasonable place at the moment - I've got quite a level head on my shoulders - and am quite capable of dealing with paperwork like this,\" Mr Durdle said. \"But I'm a member of the charity Widowed and Young, and I've seen first-hand in there how a letter like this or something like it can completely derail somebody. \"If I'm going to make any fuss about this at all, it's to make sure that PayPal - or any other organisation that might do this kind of insensitive thing - recognises the damage they can cause the recently bereaved.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45194333", "content": "A mysterious Russian satellite displaying \"very abnormal behaviour\" has raised alarm in the US, according to a State Department official. \"We don't know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it,\" said assistant secretary Yleem Poblete at a conference in Switzerland on 14 August. She voiced fears that it was impossible to say if the object may be a weapon. Russia has dismissed the comments as \"unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions\". The satellite in question was launched in October last year. \"[The satellite's] behaviour on-orbit was inconsistent with anything seen before from on-orbit inspection or space situational awareness capabilities, including other Russian inspection satellite activities,\" Ms Poblete told the conference on disarmament in Switzerland. \"Russian intentions with respect to this satellite are unclear and are obviously a very troubling development,\" she added, citing recent comments made by the commander of Russia's Space Forces, who said adopting \"new prototypes of weapons\" was a key objective for the force. Ms Poblete said that the US had \"serious concerns\" that Russia was developing anti-satellite weapons. Alexander Deyneko, a senior Russian diplomat, told the Reuters news agency that the comments were \"the same unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions, on suppositions and so on\". He called on the US to contribute to a Russian-Chinese treaty that seeks to prevent an arms race in space. Space weapons may be designed to cause damage in more subtle ways than traditional weapons like guns, which could cause a lot of debris in orbit, explained Alexandra Stickings, a space security expert at the Royal United Services Institute. \"[Such weapons may include] lasers or microwave frequencies that could just stop [a satellite] working for a time, either disable it permanently without destroying it or disrupt it via jamming,\" she said. But it was difficult to know what technology is available because so much information on space-based capabilities is classified, she added. She also said it would be very difficult to prove that any event causing interference in space was an intentional, hostile action by a specific nation state. Ms Poblete's comments were particularly interesting in light of President Donald Trump's decision to launch a sixth branch of the US armed forces named Space Force, added Ms Stickings. \"The narrative coming from the US is, 'space was really peaceful, now look at what the Russians and Chinese are doing' - ignoring the fact that the US has developed its own capabilities.\" A spokesman for the UK's Ministry of Defence said he could neither confirm nor deny any tracking of Russian satellites. \"There are a range of threats and hazards to all space capabilities in what is an increasingly contested domain,\" he said. \"These include the development of counter-space weapons by a number of nations.   \"The UK is working closely with international allies, including the US, to re-enforce responsible and safe behaviours in space and to build knowledge, understanding and resilience.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45686890", "content": "Facebook says almost 50 million of its users were left exposed by a security flaw.  The company said attackers were able to exploit a vulnerability in a feature known as \u201cView As\u201d to gain control of people's accounts.  The breach was discovered on Tuesday, Facebook said, and it has informed police.  Users that had potentially been affected were prompted to re-log-in on Friday.  The flaw has been fixed, wrote the firm\u2019s vice-president of product management, Guy Rosen, adding all affected accounts had been reset, as well as another 40 million \"as a precautionary step\". Facebook - which saw its share price drop more than 3% on Friday - has more than two billion active monthly users. The company has confirmed to reporters that the breach would allow hackers to log in to other accounts that use Facebook's system, of which there are many.  This means other major sites, such as AirBnB and Tinder, may also be affected. The firm would not say where in the world the 50 million users are, but it has informed Irish data regulators, where Facebook's European subsidiary is based. The company said the users prompted to log-in again did not have to change their passwords. \"Since we\u2019ve only just started our investigation, we have yet to determine whether these accounts were misused or any information accessed. We also don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind these attacks or where they\u2019re based. \u201c  He added: \"People\u2019s privacy and security is incredibly important, and we\u2019re sorry this happened.\"  The company has confirmed that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and its chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg were among the 50 million accounts affected.  Facebook's \"View As\" function is a privacy feature that allows people to see what their own profile looks to other users, making it clear what information is viewable to their friends, friends of friends, or the public. Attackers found multiple bugs in this feature that \"allowed them to steal Facebook access tokens, which they could then use to take over people's accounts\", Mr Rosen explained. \"Access tokens are the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to Facebook so they don't need to re-enter their password every time they use the app,\" he added. The breach comes at a time when the firm is struggling to convince lawmakers in the US and beyond, that it is capable of protecting user data.  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call on Friday that the firm took security seriously, in the face of what he said were constant attacks by bad actors. But Jeff Pollard, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester, said the fact Facebook held so much data meant it should be prepared for such attacks. \"Attackers go where the data is, and that has made Facebook an obvious target,\" he said.  \"The main concern here is that one feature of the platform allowed attackers to harvest the data of tens of millions of users.  \"This indicates that Facebook needs to make limiting access to data a priority for users, APIs, and features.\" When asked by the BBC, Facebook was unable to say if the investigation would look into why the bugs were missed, or if anyone at the company would be held accountable for the breach.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45707211", "content": "Apple has remained silent amid complaints that its new iPhone XS and XS Max smartphones fail to charge consistently when plugged in.

Video blogger Lewis Hilsenteger dubbed the issue \"chargegate\" in a video demonstrating the problem. However, Apple has not yet commented on the issue. Mr Hilsenteger presents the Unbox Therapy channel on YouTube, which has more than 12 million subscribers. In a video published on Saturday, he tested nine iPhones by plugging them into an official Apple power supply.  While the 2017 iPhone X charged without problem, many of the new XS and XS Max phones refused to charge when plugged in. Most of the phones would charge only when the display was activated to wake up the device. However, one of them would not charge at all. Mr Hilsenteger said he had been alerted to the problem when a viewer had emailed him describing their troubles. He had not noticed the issue himself because he used wireless charging rather than the power cable on his device. \"Responding to those people on a platform like this should bring light to it and hopefully some sort of software fix, if possible,\" he said in the video. \"This is my job. I have to call this stuff out. I have to hold these companies accountable.\" Several complaints about the XS and XS Max failing to charge have also been posted on Apple's discussion forum on its website. Complaints can also be found on social media, where some people have described being unable to charge their phone at all once the battery is exhausted. Some users have speculated that the problem is related to a recent change in Apple's security settings.

That could stop thieves, cyber-attackers or law enforcement officers accessing it. \"In some cases, it might not charge,\" the company advises on its website.

Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. \"I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,\" he said in an all-staff email. \"I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society\u2026 and, yes, here at Google, too.\" A Twitter feed titled @googlewalkout documented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: \"We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded.\" Anger has boiled over in the past week since the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (\u00a369m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a \u201ccredible\u201d allegation of sexual misconduct.

At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Times\u2019 report had been \"difficult to read\".  Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: \"I\u2019m not at my desk because I\u2019m walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that\u2019s not working for everyone.\" They have also made formal demands to Google\u2019s management. They are:  Forced arbitration, a common contract clause for Silicon Valley workers, demands any disputes are dealt with internally rather than through other methods such as the courts.  Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action.  \"Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening.  \"We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\"  Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism.  \"Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,\u201d said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business.  \"There are a lot of \u2018manbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money. I think you have to hit these companies where it hurts.  \"I think it empowers other Google offices when women and men are watching this happen, that they can do a similar action that's not just sitting by or making comments to one another or sharing emails.\" In the past year, Google employees have spoken out strongly against the company\u2019s work with the US Department of Defense, as well as plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search product.

She told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed. Parliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it. The prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc. After Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects. The agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.  Please upgrade your browser The priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome. Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit. While she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\". \"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can. \"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\" A no deal Brexit could \"put the public at risk\" because of reduced security collaboration with the EU, says Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick #r4today https://t.co/v9XVVpWbcm pic.twitter.com/mABJ3J6ojW End of Twitter post  by @BBCr4today The Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit. She also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary. \"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.  \"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\" Ms Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU. But campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.  The organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.  \"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.  The Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.  \"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this.

She said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".

US President Donald Trump has questioned the value of a future trade deal with the UK if it is not able to alter its tariffs and regulations.  But, at the same time, campaigners have warned that the UK may be forced to water down food safety, consumer protection and environmental standards to reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners.  MPs are calling for Parliament to be given an enhanced role in considering future trade agreements once the UK regains the power to negotiate its own deals. The cross-party committee is urging the government to operate from a \"presumption of transparency rather than secrecy\" in negotiating the UK's post-Brexit trade policy. Its new report suggests MPs debate a substantive, amendable motion before negotiations are under way, once the government has agreed an outline approach - allowing Parliament to express its \"concerns or objections\", and lowering the risk of it rejecting eventual negotiated agreements. The committee also recommends that the government hold regular consultations with interested parties, such as businesses, to enable them to share their opinions while the devolved administrations should have a statutory role in the process. The SNP's Angus MacNeil, who chairs the committee, said the government's current plans for Parliamentary input were \"characteristically vague\". \"Our report makes an unequivocal argument for transparency over secrecy, consultation over concealment, and parliamentary debate over simple rubber-stamping,\" he said. \"If the proper processes and protections are not put in place from the outset, the government may fail to realise the UK-wide post-Brexit benefits it has gone to such lengths to promote.\" A Department for International Trade spokesperson said it had been \"very clear that we will not lower food standards as part of any new free trade agreement\".

Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. \"Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,\" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Confusingly the 83-page document does not forecast the impact of the prime minister's current deal. Instead it looks at the potential impact of the proposals agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers in July, which is the basis of the current proposal. Under those circumstances the economy would be 3.9% smaller than if the UK had remained part of the European Union. The estimates do not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that 3.9% of GDP would equate to about \u00a3100bn a year by the 2030s. The government report also examines three other possible scenarios including a no-deal Brexit, which would be the most damaging. The economy will continue to grow under all the scenarios, but there is a wide variation in how much. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis questioned the research, saying previous Treasury forecasts had been proved wrong and were based on \"flawed assumptions\". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the planned Brexit deal combined most of the economic benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU. Asked if the UK would be poorer under Mrs May's deal, he said: \"The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister's preferred version of the future partnership.\" But Mr Hammond argued that staying in the EU was not politically \"viable\". Veteran Conservative Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash said Mr Hammond was effectively arguing for the UK to stay in the European Union in his \"extraordinary\" statement. He said the chancellor had ignored potential economic benefits of leaving the EU, asking: \"What about the trade deals which could give us the most enormous opportunities throughout the world, if we are able to strike them?\" Under Mrs May's deal, the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals during the transition period after 29 March's Brexit day, but would not be able to implement them until the end of the planned 21-month transition period, which could itself be extended. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal.  That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't. The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth.  There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option.  That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate.

But that's not the only treat 2019 has in store. From Stormzy to The Spice Girls, the next 12 months will see the return of the planet's biggest pop stars, and a few exciting new names taking their first steps into the big league. Here's a not-entirely-comprehensive preview of the year ahead.  2018 was a fallow year for most of pop's A-listers - with a knock-on effect on album sales, which fell by an estimated 25%. But the new year promises a crop of major releases that could reverse that trend. 1) Rihanna - To be confirmed It's been three years since Rihanna last graced fans with new music, but the long wait for a follow-up to Anti may soon be over.  In response to a fan asking \"When is the album dropping?\" on Instagram, the star simply stated: \"2019\". Her long-term vocal producer Kuk Harrell also teased details about Rihanna's ninth album, telling fans: \"R9 is great. R9 is amazing. It's incredible, And that's all I'm going to say.\" That's about all we know - although it's likely RiRi will also appear on the soundtrack to Guava Island, the mysterious film she's been shooting with Childish Gambino in Cuba. 2) Lana Del Rey - Norman Rockwell Back in November, Lana Del Rey released two singles that updated her trademark sound with a washed-out psychedelia. The highlight was the 10-minute-long Venice Bitch, a dreamy love song evoking faded summers, Robert Frost and Norman Rockwell - after whom she's named her sixth album. It's being produced by Jack Antonoff, whose work with Lorde, Taylor Swift and St Vincent has resulted in some of the most complex, intelligent pop of the last five years. The album is due in March, preceded by (uh-oh) a book of poetry. 3) The 1975 - Notes on a Conditional Form End of Youtube post  by BBCRadio1VEVO Recorded at the same time as 2018's A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, The 1975's fourth album is due in the summer - part of singer Matty Healy's plan to combat the constant-consumption culture of modern pop.  \"Very early on, [Matt] noted that the promotional window on music is shorter than ever, and the time that people consume it is infinite,\" the band's manager Jamie Oborne told Music Week. \"If we have a tour cycle that's going to last 18 months to two years, we have to release two records in the time that we would have previously have released one.\" Matty's father, actor Tim Healy, confirmed the band had recorded one of his songs for the album. Had a brill day recording a song I wrote when Matty was 11 he wanted it on his new album yippee you can hear it in April love you guys xxxx pic.twitter.com/2v5XJdp1Rh End of Twitter post  by @TheRealTimHealy 4) Dua Lipa - To be confirmed Like The 1975, Dua Lipa knows attention spans are getting shorter, so she's plugged the gap between her Brit Award-winning debut and her in-progress second album with a clutch of collaborations with Mark Ronson, Diplo, Calvin Harris and... er, Andrea Bocelli. Meanwhile, she's been hitting the studio with the likes of Max Martin (Britney, Taylor Swift) MNEK (Little Mix, Beyonce), Andrew Wyatt (Lorde, Bruno Mars), Sarah Hudson (Katy Perry, Camila Cabello) Justin Tranter (Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez) and Swedish pop star Tove Lo. The singer told Rolling Stone she'd been listening to Prince, Outkast and Gnarls Barkley in the studio, explaining the album \"has some throwback elements, which I'm excited about 'cause it's a new direction for me\". 5) Stormzy - To be confirmed \"They told me back in summer I should drop a summer tune/But I've been working hard, the second album's coming soon.\" Stormzy teased his new album in a freestyle, 4pm In London, earlier this year. And with a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon, we should expect new material sooner rather than later. Like his debut, Gang Signs & Prayer, the album's been recorded with producer Fraser T Smith, who said the star had reached new levels with \"his singing voice, the delivery of his raps [and] his musicality\". He told Music Week: \"There's no way he's going to be just recycling Gang Signs & Prayer.\" 6) Foals - To be confirmed Foals' first album since 2015's What Went Down is also their first without founding bassist Walter Gervers, and the indications are that it will see the band make a big sonic shift. \"It's evolution versus extinction,\" frontman Yannis Philippakis told the Oxford Union last year. \"What we need to do is go through some sort of violent change and make sure, whatever the next record is, it's not friends with the last two.\" 7) Ariana Grande - Thank U, Next End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Ariana Grande's Sweetener - which came sixth in our best albums of 2018 - was only released in August, but the pop star has already hit the studio to record the follow-up. That's partly because life has moved on - the love affair that inspired Sweetener's most romantic moments has ended - and partly because she's fed up with the music industry's relentless album-tour cycle. \"My dream has always been to be - obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does,\" she told Billboard. \"It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.\" The first single, Thank U, Next, topped the charts for six weeks in the UK, pushing back plans to release the album before the end of 2018, but it seems likely Ariana's fifth album will be out before her Sweetener World Tour kicks off in March. 8) Madonna - To be confirmed Madonna's 14th studio album [discounting her various soundtrack albums] is ready to roll, ahead of a rumoured Glastonbury appearance in June.  Tentatively titled Magic, it sees the star back in the studio with French \"disco god\" Mirwais, who co-produced Music and American Life; and Mike Dean, who's best known for working with Kanye West and Frank Ocean. She deliberately restricted her pool of collaborators after the anything goes approach of 2015's Rebel Heart, writing on Instagram: \"Remember when I made records with other artists from beginning to end and I was allowed to be a visionary and not to have to go to songwriting camps where no-one can sit still for more than 15 minutes?\" 9) Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings End of Youtube post 2 by BBCRadio1VEVO Trailed by the monumental Miley Cyrus collaboration Nothing Breaks Like A Heart, Mark Ronson's fifth record is a classic break-up album, prompted by his divorce from French model and actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume. Describing the project as a collection of \"sad bangers\", the producer told the BBC: \"I tried doing some other music, whatever I could do not to relive Uptown Funk, but the only stuff that started to stick was the stuff that moved me and made me feel melancholy.\" 10) Taylor Swift - To be confirmed The three-year gap between Taylor Swift's 1989 and Reputation was the longest she'd ever made fans wait for new music. But with a new recording contract signed and sealed, it looks like TS7 could be on its way by the end of 2019. Although nothing's confirmed yet, the star told Perez Hilton her seventh album \"will definitely be out before I'm 30\" next December, while fans are convinced she's teasing a new album via the medium of Scrabble tiles.  Let the games BEGIN. A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 21, 2018 at 12:55am PDT End of Instagram post  by taylorswift And that's not all... We're also expecting new albums from Vampire Weekend, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Childish Gambino, The Chemical Brothers, The Cure, Ellie Goulding, The Strokes, James Blake, Tame Impala, The Weeknd, Maren Morris, Missy Elliott, Run The Jewels, Solange, Grimes, Weezer, Marina and Bastille. With Charli XCX singing about 1999 and Anne-Marie reminiscing about 2002, nostalgia for the turn of the millennium is in full swing - so it only seems appropriate that The Spice Girls are heading off on their second reunion tour - without the help of Posh, who's apparently got a global fashion empire to oversee. Their 13-date stadium tour kicks off in Dublin on 24 May and rattles around the UK before landing in Wembley Stadium for three nights in June. If that's not enough 90s nostalgia for you, the new year will also see tours by Take That, Boyzone and Backstreet Boys. Massive Attack will also be back, staging an ambitious 21st anniversary production of their 1998 album Mezzanine, which they describe as \"our own personalised nostalgia nightmare head trip\". Over in Las Vegas, Lady Gaga ushers in the new year with a game-changing residency that juggles two shows - a greatest hits extravaganza and a more intimate piano-jazz soiree.  Former Vegas stalwart Cher, meanwhile, hits the road in the autumn for her first world tour in 14 years. With wry self-awareness, the show is titled The Here We Go Again Tour, and will focus on her recent album of Abba covers. The actual Abba are, for the 26th year in a row, refusing to reform, although a \"hologram tour\" is supposedly in the works, as is a TV special featuring two new songs from Sweden's finest. And palaeontologists will be pleased to hear that 2019 is a bumper year for rock dinosaurs - with Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, Sir Elton John, Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton all touching down in the UK.  Catch them while you still can... After the success of The Greatest Showman, Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star Is Born this year, Hollywood is scrambling to capitalise on the apparent appetite for musicals. 2019 will see new film adaptations of Cats, The Lion King and Aladdin, but the most-anticipated of the lot has to be the Frozen sequel, which is due in December. There's also a lot of buzz around Teen Spirit, which stars Elle Fanning as a shy Isle Of Wight teenager who enters an X Factor-style music contest. After its premiere in Toronto, Deadline said the film was \"reminiscent of a new-age Flashdance, only with the emphasis on singing instead of dancing\". Sir Elton's back catalogue will get an overhaul in Rocket Man - starring Taron Egerton as the bespectacled pianist; and directed by Dexter Fletcher, who rescued Bohemian Rhapsody from the scrap-heap when Bryan Singer was fired. And rounding out the year is Last Christmas, a romantic comedy inspired by Wham's holiday hit, which will also feature unreleased George Michael music.  End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Ones to watch for 2019 include Jade Bird, whose rip-roaring country-rock songs have lit up playlists on both sides of the Atlantic; and 17-year-old Billie Eilish, who currently gets 24 million monthly listeners on Spotify for her ominous tales of angst and obsession. Tyneside's Sam Fender has already won the Brits Critics' Choice Award for his emotionally-charged indie rock (check out Dead Boys, which tackles the issue of male suicide) while the longlist for the BBC's Sound of 2019 includes flamenco star Rosal\u00eda, R&B singer Ella Mai and queer pop songwriter King Princess. The winner will be revealed on 11 January. Nominations for the Brit Awards are announced a day later - with George Ezra locked on for best male and best album for Staying At Tamara's, the UK's best-selling new release of 2018. Arctic Monkeys, Clean Bandit and Florence + The Machine should also grab a nomination or two. At the Grammys, British star Dua Lipa is a frontrunner for best new artist, while Kacey Musgraves could be the first country act to win album of the year since 2010. Elsewhere, Childish Gambino, Cardi B, Janelle Monae and Drake all have multiple shots at the night's big prizes. But the biggest question mark hanging over the music industry in 2019 is the impact of Brexit.  How will the visa situation affect touring musicians? Will there be a price hike for vinyl and CDs, which are largely manufactured in Europe? And will Damon Albarn be forced to write another album about the political fallout?

Ministers hope to begin negotiating deals with key partners once the UK leaves the EU in March and start implementing them from 2021 onwards. The International Trade Committee said MPs must have a \"meaningful role\" in ratifying deals, with scrutiny at an early stage and a decisive final vote. The government is not obliged to give Parliament a vote on treaties it signs. However, ministers bowed to pressure and agreed to give MPs a vote on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU which, if the Commons approves it next month, will take the form of a treaty.

The warrant allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. The UK wants to stay part of the system when it leaves the EU next March. But Mr Barnier said the UK could not, because of its desire to leave the EU's court and free movement scheme. The EU would consider setting up a \"streamlined\" extradition process with the UK instead, said Mr Barnier. His words are not likely to go down well with the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, who earlier this month singled the European Arrest Warrant out as one of the cornerstones of post-Brexit security co-operation with the EU. He said it had \"brought dangerous people swiftly to justice\" and \"played a crucial role in supporting police co-operation, not least in Northern Ireland and Ireland\". Mr Barnier said \"facts have consequences\" and the UK's decision to leave the EU and its single market meant things could not stay the way they were now. He said the UK's decision to opt out of free movement rules and largely end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice \"means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant\". He suggested it would not be \"fair\" for the UK to keep all the benefits of EU membership.  \"They want to maintain all the benefits of the current relationship, while leaving the EU regulatory, supervision, and application framework,\" he said.  \"And they try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It would mean wasting time we don't have.\" Mr Barnier said that aside from the European Court of Justice the arrest warrant was also underpinned by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by the concept of EU citizenship. He added: \"Today we know that the UK is not ready to accept the free movement of people, the jurisdiction of the court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights - for the charter, this was confirmed last week by the House of Commons. \"This means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant.\" The EU's remaining 27 countries would continue to share information from passenger name records and the UK would not have automatic access to EU-only police databases or those of countries in the Schengen zone, he said in a speech in Vienna. Similarly, while the UK would be shown analysis done by Europol relating to live criminal investigations, it would not be able to \"shape the direction\" of the EU's law enforcement agency or other EU bodies. Shared efforts to counter money-laundering and terrorist finance must continue, Mr Barnier said, but judicial co-operation in criminal matters could not extend to continued membership of the European Arrest Warrant. Successive UK governments have remained strong supporters of the European Arrest Warrant - which came into force in 2004 - despite calls from some Tory MPs for it to be renegotiated or reformed.  According to the National Crime Agency, other EU members requested the arrest of 14,279 UK-based suspects in 2015-6, up from 1,865 in 2004. The UK made 241 such requests in 2015-6, leading to 150 arrests. Speaking at the same event as Mr Barnier, leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt said \"solutions were possible\" to ensure public safety was not compromised by Brexit but he made clear the status quo was not an option. \"They cannot be simply based on continuing the same processes as before,\" he said.  In response, the Department for Exiting the European Union said protecting the public was an \"absolute priority\".  \"Any drop in the breadth and quality of co-operation would have a direct impact on public safety and on our collective ability to deliver justice across Europe,\" a spokesman said.  Earlier this year the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said non-participation in the scheme was \"probably the biggest practical vulnerability\" facing law enforcement in Northern Ireland post-Brexit. George Hamilton told a House of Lords committee there would be \"very real operational consequences if there are no alternative arrangements in place around exchange of material and people by way of a European arrest warrant\".", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46600850", "content": "The cabinet has decided to \"ramp up\" preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid uncertainty over the fate of Theresa May's proposed EU exit deal.  It allocated to ministries \u00a32bn set aside in case the UK leaves on 29 March without MPs having accepted any deal. Letters will be sent to 140,000 firms updating them on what they should do while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to help government departments.  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it amounted to \"psychological warfare\". With 101 days left until Brexit and many MPs still opposed to the government's withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on in mid-January, ministers met for a longer-than-normal two and a half hour meeting. They agreed that businesses should activate their own no deal contingency plans, as they think appropriate. Updated Revenue and Customs information packs will be sent to firms later this week, setting out what changes could be needed at the border.  Consumers are being advised to familiarise themselves with advice published this summer, in areas ranging from booking flights to using credit cards, with more details promised in the coming weeks.  Please upgrade your browser The Treasury said \u00a3480m of the \u00a32bn of preparation funding would go to the Home Office, helping it to employ more Border Force officers and boost national security. Defra would receive \u00a3410m, allowing it to focus on ensuring the trade in fish, food products and chemicals remains uninterrupted.  HMRC, which is being allocated \u00a3375m, plans to hire more than 3,000 new staff to handle increases in customs activities, as well as investing in new technology at borders. The next largest allocations will be \u00a3190m for the Department for Business and \u00a3128m for the Department for International Trade. Separately, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs that 3,500 military personnel, including logisticians and engineers as well as infantry units, were ready to be deployed if needed. About 10% of the force would be reservists who will receive their call up papers in the middle of January so that if needed they would be ready in March.  In other developments: Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the cabinet had agreed that \"preparing for a no deal will be an operational priority within government but our overall priority is to secure a deal\". He said no-deal planning \"needs to be much more of a priority for businesses\" and there would be a \"significant increase\" in the guidance issued to them over the next 14 weeks, as Brexit day approaches. E-mails will be sent out to 80,000 of those businesses most like to be affected over the next few days. In the autumn of 2017, The Treasury earmarked \u00a33bn for no-deal planning between 2018 and 2020.  In March, Chancellor Philip Hammond said half of that had been allocated to 20 government departments, with the Home Office, transport, the environment and business among the largest recipients.  At Tuesday's cabinet meeting ministers approved the second tranche - plus an under-spend from the current year - to go to departments for the 2019/20 year, with the priority areas being borders, security and international trade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already ordered full \"no deal\" planning across the National Health Service, he told the BBC's Newsnight on Monday. But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, criticised UK ministers, who he said were \"glorifying\" the prospect of leaving without a comprehensive deal in the hope individual agreements could be reached in areas like transport and livestock movements.  Those, like Jeremy Hunt, who glorify a no\u2013deal #Brexit are totally irresponsible. It is not the job of politicians to make the people they lead poorer, remove opportunities, rights & make lives more uncertain. There is no such thing as a \"managed no deal\". https://t.co/f1sPT4R2KS End of Twitter post  by @guyverhofstadt And Labour said a no-deal exit was \"not viable\" and it would work with other parties to stop it. \"It is testament to the prime minister's failure in these negotiations that the government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table,\" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. And the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for another referendum, said the government was \"attempting to scare\" MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal. \"Theresa May is irresponsibly trying to run down the clock so that the only option is to support her discredited deal,\" Sir Vince Cable said.  MPs will vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations, in the middle of January. The deal will only come into force if both the UK and European parliaments approve it. The BBC understands Mrs May is planning to use the Commons vote as a \"moment of reckoning\" for the Brexit process.  Sources have told the BBC that Downing Street will not stand in the way of MPs who seek to amend the government's motion on the Brexit deal to put forward potential alternatives.  The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to push for a further vote of no-confidence in the government as a whole. On Monday night, the Labour leader tabled a motion calling on MPs to declare they have no confidence in the prime minister because she failed to have a vote on her Brexit deal straight away. No 10 has refused to make time for the motion and Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed on Tuesday that there were under no obligation to do so.  Other parties - the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - have called on Mr Corbyn to push for a no-confidence vote against the government as a whole. Unlike a vote aimed at the prime minister, the government would have to allow a vote on this motion and, if successful, it could force a general election. Northern Ireland's DUP, whose votes the Conservative government has relied on in big votes since the June 2017 election, said they would not support Labour.  Mrs May also appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader.  One of them, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would never vote against Mrs May or a Conservative government. He said on Tuesday evening that he had a \"civilised and courteous\" meeting with the PM, and that the government was \"prudent\" to engage in no-deal planning.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45325701", "content": "Theresa May has announced plans to boost Britain's investment in Africa after Brexit, during her first trip to the continent as prime minister. In a speech in Cape Town, she pledged \u00a34bn in support for African economies, to create jobs for young people. She also pledged a \"fundamental shift\" in aid spending to focus on long-term economic and security challenges rather than short-term poverty reduction. She will also visit Nigeria and Kenya during the three-day trade mission. On her way to South Africa, the prime minister played down warnings from the chancellor about the economic damage a no-deal Brexit could cause. Talking to journalists on board RAF Voyager on Tuesday morning, Mrs May reiterated that she believed a no-deal Brexit was still better than a bad deal - adding no-deal \"wouldn't be the end of the world\". Last week Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in a letter that a no-deal Brexit could damage the economy.  Mrs May's trip - which will see her meet the presidents of all three countries - aims to deepen economic and trade ties with growing African economies ahead of Britain leaving the EU in 2019. Arriving in South Africa on Tuesday morning, Mrs May said she wanted the UK to overtake the US to become the G7's biggest investor in Africa by 2022. She promised to continue existing economic links based on the UK's EU membership - including an EU-wide partnership with the Southern African Customs Union and Mozambique - after Brexit next year.  Promising an extra \u00a34bn in direct UK government investment - which she expects to be matched by the private sector - she said while the UK could not match the \"economic might\" of some foreign investors - such as China or the US - it offered long-term opportunities of the \"highest quality and breadth\".  She defended the UK's aid spending in Africa, a target of criticism from some Tory MPs, saying it had \"worked\" to give millions of children and women an education and immunise millions against deadly diseases. But she said she was \"unashamed\" that it had to work in the UK's own interest and pledged a new approach in future, focusing on helping British private sector companies invest in fast-growing countries like Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal while \"bolstering states under threat\" from Islamist extremism such as Chad, Mali and Niger.  \"True partnerships are not about one party doing unto another, but states, governments, businesses and individuals working together in a responsible way to achieve common goals,\" she said. The UK's overseas aid budget totalled \u00a313.9bn in 2017, an increase of \u00a3555m in 2016. UK direct investment in Africa was \u00a342.7bn in 2016, compared with \u00a344.3bn from the US, \u00a338bn from France and \u00a331bn from China, according to data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By BBC News reporter Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg Theresa May is on a charm offensive. This is the first visit by a UK prime minister to South Africa in five years - the last visit was by David Cameron when he came for Nelson Mandela's memorial in 2013. But this trip was prompted by Brexit, as with the UK leaving the European Union next year, it needs to strengthen its trade agreements around the world. Mrs May's address to business leaders was peppered with flattery about the continent's potential, as well as noting concerns about challenges around security and poverty, and she promised a mutually beneficial relationship. But some say the UK is late to the trade party, with countries like China already having firm trade partnerships across Africa. Africa is changing, re-imagining itself and rejecting the label of the \"dark continent\". Many in South Africa, and indeed across the continent, will be keen to see how the UK, which has at times been criticised for being too focused on aid rather than trade, demonstrates its shift to seeing the continent as an equal partner at the table. Mrs May said national self-interest and global co-operation were not in conflict and the UK could play a key role in harnessing the \"innovation and creativity\" of young people in Africa, 60% of whose population is under the age of 25.  \"The challenges facing Africa are not Africa's alone,\" she said. \"It is the world's interest to see these jobs created.\" Lord Boateng, chair of the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, praised the government's \"proactive spirit\" at making more opportunities for British business on the continent, but said the UK was \"late to the party\". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One:  \"The reality is that the Chinese, the French, the Indians, indeed Korea, Japan, Germany even, tend to have had a much more proactive response to business in Africa than we traditionally have had.  \"We have a lot of catching up to do if we are to make the most of what is an historic opportunity to recast the relationship between Africa and the UK away from it being seen solely as a philanthropic exercise, a basket case suitable only for [oversees aid], to an opportunity that requires investment, that requires risk taking and support by government for British companies.\" Sharon Constancon, chair of the South African Chamber of Commerce in London, said the UK's aims were ambitious given that it currently ranked seventh and eighth respectively in terms of exports and imports to South Africa, the continent's largest economy. During talks with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mrs May said she raised the issue of his government's controversial land reform program, which has been criticised by US President Donald Trump - who last week claimed that white farmers were being murdered and their property expropriated. The UK PM said she supported measures that were legal, transparent and had democratic approval, welcoming Mr Ramaphosa's assurances there would be \"no smash and grab\" seizures of land.  By Larry Madowo, BBC Africa business editor The UK's historical relationship with many African countries still counts for something, but, as Prime Minister Theresa May will find on her trip to the continent, the UK now vies for attention with larger economies offering greater riches. The continent's leaders need to decide who to prioritise: an ambitious but friendly China, the huge European Union bloc, the potential riches of the United States, or the historically-linked United Kingdom.  The prime minister's trip comes a week before the huge Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. Dozens of African heads of state are expected there and China may offer new trade and finance deals. Mrs May's trip seems rather low key in comparison. Tuesday - Mrs May flew into Cape Town where she met young people, before delivering a keynote speech on trade and how UK private sector investment could be brought into Africa. After a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, she visited Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. She had a guided tour and was handed a key to open the cell Mr Mandela was imprisoned in, before writing in the guestbook: \"His legacy lives on in the hopes and dreams of young people here in South Africa and around the world.\" Wednesday - Mrs May intends to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital Abuja before meeting victims of modern slavery in Lagos. Thursday - In Kenya, Mrs May will meet president Uhuru Kenyatta before visiting British troops and a business school. A state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta will conclude the trip.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43314976", "content": "Donald Tusk has insisted the EU \"does not want to build a wall\", but Brexit means \"we will be drifting apart\". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to \"demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success\", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveiling draft guidelines for the EU side of Brexit trade talks. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an \"ambitious and advanced\" free trade deal - and continued access to UK waters for EU fishing vessels. \"Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother,\" he said. \"It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit.\" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would \"loosen, not strengthen, economic ties\". The draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods - where the EU has a surplus. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be \"no cherry-picking\" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the \"narrow negotiating mandate set out in these guidelines suggests that the EU doesn't think it will be much more ambitious than other free trade agreements it has negotiated - Canada is the most obvious example\". Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. But he added: \"No member state is free to pick only those sectors of the internal market they like, or to accept the role of the ECJ only when it suits their interest.\" The draft guidelines also say that the EU will \"preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies\".  Mrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an \"off-the-shelf\" model. \"The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,\" she said. \"If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking.\" She also said: \"We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies.\" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The EU says it wants to maintain \"existing reciprocal access to fishing waters\" - a leading concern of the fishing industry in countries bordering the North Sea. In her Mansion House speech, Mrs May said: \"The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters.\" She added that the UK would want to \"work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry\". Brexit Secretary David Davis - quizzed on Tuesday by Brexiteer Labour MP Kate Hoey - insisted the government would not betray UK fishing communities by \"trading away fishing rights\" for \"other things\". Asked about the EU's demand to keep access as it is now, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK was \"open to discussing with our EU partners about the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal access for our fishermen to EU waters and for EU fishermen to our waters\". Campaign group Fishing for Leave urged the government not to \"cave in\" to the EU demands, saying: \"Nowhere else is access to fisheries included as negotiating collateral for a free trade agreement.\" Financial services are not mentioned specifically in the EU draft guidelines, but it is shaping up to be a major sticking point. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. \"Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU 27, it's hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement,\" he said in a speech. \"Not only is it possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but this is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" But Donald Tusk appeared to reject the UK proposals. The EU says the UK will be treated like any other \"third country\" after Brexit. Asked about the EU guidelines, which also warn of the \"negative economic consequences\" of Brexit, Mr Hammond said: \"It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do.\" EU deal 'must include financial services' Donald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg.  A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services.  I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK.  But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines.  The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice.  MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43189878", "content": "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed the UK being in a permanent customs union with the EU in a speech setting out his approach to Brexit. He said this would avoid the need for a \"hard border\" in Northern Ireland and ensure free-flowing trade for business. The policy shift could lead to Labour siding with Tory rebels to defeat Theresa May on her Brexit strategy. But a customs union after Brexit would be a \"complete sell out\", International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will argue. Mr Corbyn insisted in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg that his speech was a \"firming up\" of Labour's existing policy, which was to back customs union membership during the planned two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. In his speech, at Coventry University, Mr Corbyn said Labour would be \"looking for a Brexit that puts the working people first\". In a shift from the party's policy at last year's general election, he said the UK should strike a new customs deal with the EU at the end of transition.   \"Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union,\" he said. \"We have long argued that a customs union is a viable option for the final deal.  \"So Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland.\" The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave both the single market and the customs union, allowing it to negotiate its own post-Brexit trade deals. Mrs May will give details in a speech on Friday of how her plan for a \"managed diversion\" from the EU will work in practice, after first briefing the cabinet.  The Conservatives accused Mr Corbyn of \"betraying millions of Labour voters\" who had backed Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Labour's \"confused policy would be bad for jobs and wages\".  And in a speech on Tuesday, he will say the UK would find itself in a \"worse position\" than it is now if it leaves the existing customs union but negotiates a similar arrangement. A customs union allows free-flowing trade between member nations without making companies pay export taxes, or tariffs, at the border.  However, the members normally have joint trade agreements with countries not in their customs union.   A single market is a deeper form of co-operation, which effectively merges the economies of member states together, allowing the free movement of goods, services, money and people as if they were part of a single country. Mr Corbyn rejected calls from pro-EU figures like Lord Mandelson and a number of his own backbenchers to commit to staying in the EU single market, saying instead that he wanted a \"close relationship\" with it. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out continuing with free movement of people between the UK and the EU in some form after Brexit, under Labour's plans, but he told BBC News it would have to be negotiated - as would any financial contribution the UK would make. He said the UK could work \"jointly\" with the EU after Brexit to strike trade deals with other nations - something the government insists is not possible. Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ian Watson  So the dividing lines are clear politically - if less clear in practice. Clear politically, because the government is committed to coming out of the customs union. And in contrast Labour now says it wants to negotiate \"a new comprehensive customs union\" with the EU. That puts clear blue water between opposition and government - and may signal to Remain voters that Labour wants a 'softer' Brexit, staying closer to the EU.  But in practice, there may be fewer differences than meets the eye.  Jeremy Corbyn wants a customs union that would still give the UK a say in EU-led trade deals - which the EU may resist. And Theresa May has spoken of a new \"customs arrangement,\" which would, er, allow independent trade deals.  But it's currently in the government and opposition's political interests to emphasise the differences,  not the similarities.  Jeremy Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether his policy shift was an attempt to remove Theresa May from office and force a general election. Tory rebels have been tight-lipped about whether they would vote against Mrs May if it came down to a confidence vote in her premiership, saying that was unlikely to happen.  But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Leave and said Mr Corbyn was once more Eurosceptic than him, told the BBC that being in a customs union or the single market would be a \"deceit\" and dismissed suggestions Tory rebels could join with Labour to defeat the government as \"fairy tales\" and they would win any vote by a large majority. Mr Corbyn was an opponent of the EU when he was a backbench Labour MP, as he explained in his speech. \"I have long opposed the embedding of free market orthodoxy and the democratic deficit in the European Union, and that is why I campaigned to 'remain and reform' in the referendum campaign.\" He said scepticism was \"healthy\" but \"often the term 'Eurosceptic' in reality became synonymous with 'anti-European' and I am not anti-European at all, I want to see close and progressive cooperation with the whole of Europe after Brexit\". He said this \"new relationship\" he wanted to negotiate with the EU would ensure Labour could deliver on its plans to nationalise public utilities, invest in industry and curb the outsourcing of public services. Mr Corbyn's speech was welcomed by Britain's largest trade unions while industry body, the CBI, said staying in a customs union would \"grow trade without accepting freedom of movement or payments to the EU\".  Pro-European Labour MPs said he had not gone far enough and urged him to commit to staying in the single market. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was the \"first step in a complete Labour sell-out\" while the DUP, the party Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, said it was \"cheap political opportunism\". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable tweeted that Mr Corbyn's customs union stance was a \"small step to sanity\", but added: \"In #SingleMarket he is still following @theresa-may cake and eat it policy. Just wants red cherries rather than blue raisins.\"", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46712694", "content": "Dame June Whitfield - celebrated for her comic roles in BBC sitcom Terry and June and cult favourite Absolutely Fabulous - has died aged 93.

The warrant allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. The UK wants to stay part of the system when it leaves the EU next March. But Mr Barnier said the UK could not, because of its desire to leave the EU's court and free movement scheme. The EU would consider setting up a \"streamlined\" extradition process with the UK instead, said Mr Barnier. His words are not likely to go down well with the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, who earlier this month singled the European Arrest Warrant out as one of the cornerstones of post-Brexit security co-operation with the EU. He said it had \"brought dangerous people swiftly to justice\" and \"played a crucial role in supporting police co-operation, not least in Northern Ireland and Ireland\". Mr Barnier said \"facts have consequences\" and the UK's decision to leave the EU and its single market meant things could not stay the way they were now. He said the UK's decision to opt out of free movement rules and largely end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice \"means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant\". He suggested it would not be \"fair\" for the UK to keep all the benefits of EU membership.  \"They want to maintain all the benefits of the current relationship, while leaving the EU regulatory, supervision, and application framework,\" he said.  \"And they try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It would mean wasting time we don't have.\" Mr Barnier said that aside from the European Court of Justice the arrest warrant was also underpinned by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by the concept of EU citizenship. He added: \"Today we know that the UK is not ready to accept the free movement of people, the jurisdiction of the court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights - for the charter, this was confirmed last week by the House of Commons. \"This means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant.\" The EU's remaining 27 countries would continue to share information from passenger name records and the UK would not have automatic access to EU-only police databases or those of countries in the Schengen zone, he said in a speech in Vienna. Similarly, while the UK would be shown analysis done by Europol relating to live criminal investigations, it would not be able to \"shape the direction\" of the EU's law enforcement agency or other EU bodies. Shared efforts to counter money-laundering and terrorist finance must continue, Mr Barnier said, but judicial co-operation in criminal matters could not extend to continued membership of the European Arrest Warrant. Successive UK governments have remained strong supporters of the European Arrest Warrant - which came into force in 2004 - despite calls from some Tory MPs for it to be renegotiated or reformed.  According to the National Crime Agency, other EU members requested the arrest of 14,279 UK-based suspects in 2015-6, up from 1,865 in 2004. The UK made 241 such requests in 2015-6, leading to 150 arrests. Speaking at the same event as Mr Barnier, leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt said \"solutions were possible\" to ensure public safety was not compromised by Brexit but he made clear the status quo was not an option. \"They cannot be simply based on continuing the same processes as before,\" he said.  In response, the Department for Exiting the European Union said protecting the public was an \"absolute priority\".  \"Any drop in the breadth and quality of co-operation would have a direct impact on public safety and on our collective ability to deliver justice across Europe,\" a spokesman said.  Earlier this year the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said non-participation in the scheme was \"probably the biggest practical vulnerability\" facing law enforcement in Northern Ireland post-Brexit. George Hamilton told a House of Lords committee there would be \"very real operational consequences if there are no alternative arrangements in place around exchange of material and people by way of a European arrest warrant\".", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46600850", "content": "The cabinet has decided to \"ramp up\" preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid uncertainty over the fate of Theresa May's proposed EU exit deal.  It allocated to ministries \u00a32bn set aside in case the UK leaves on 29 March without MPs having accepted any deal. Letters will be sent to 140,000 firms updating them on what they should do while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to help government departments.  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it amounted to \"psychological warfare\". With 101 days left until Brexit and many MPs still opposed to the government's withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on in mid-January, ministers met for a longer-than-normal two and a half hour meeting. They agreed that businesses should activate their own no deal contingency plans, as they think appropriate. Updated Revenue and Customs information packs will be sent to firms later this week, setting out what changes could be needed at the border.  Consumers are being advised to familiarise themselves with advice published this summer, in areas ranging from booking flights to using credit cards, with more details promised in the coming weeks.  Please upgrade your browser The Treasury said \u00a3480m of the \u00a32bn of preparation funding would go to the Home Office, helping it to employ more Border Force officers and boost national security. Defra would receive \u00a3410m, allowing it to focus on ensuring the trade in fish, food products and chemicals remains uninterrupted.  HMRC, which is being allocated \u00a3375m, plans to hire more than 3,000 new staff to handle increases in customs activities, as well as investing in new technology at borders. The next largest allocations will be \u00a3190m for the Department for Business and \u00a3128m for the Department for International Trade. Separately, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs that 3,500 military personnel, including logisticians and engineers as well as infantry units, were ready to be deployed if needed. About 10% of the force would be reservists who will receive their call up papers in the middle of January so that if needed they would be ready in March.  In other developments: Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the cabinet had agreed that \"preparing for a no deal will be an operational priority within government but our overall priority is to secure a deal\". He said no-deal planning \"needs to be much more of a priority for businesses\" and there would be a \"significant increase\" in the guidance issued to them over the next 14 weeks, as Brexit day approaches. E-mails will be sent out to 80,000 of those businesses most like to be affected over the next few days. In the autumn of 2017, The Treasury earmarked \u00a33bn for no-deal planning between 2018 and 2020.  In March, Chancellor Philip Hammond said half of that had been allocated to 20 government departments, with the Home Office, transport, the environment and business among the largest recipients.  At Tuesday's cabinet meeting ministers approved the second tranche - plus an under-spend from the current year - to go to departments for the 2019/20 year, with the priority areas being borders, security and international trade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already ordered full \"no deal\" planning across the National Health Service, he told the BBC's Newsnight on Monday. But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, criticised UK ministers, who he said were \"glorifying\" the prospect of leaving without a comprehensive deal in the hope individual agreements could be reached in areas like transport and livestock movements.  Those, like Jeremy Hunt, who glorify a no\u2013deal #Brexit are totally irresponsible. It is not the job of politicians to make the people they lead poorer, remove opportunities, rights & make lives more uncertain. There is no such thing as a \"managed no deal\". https://t.co/f1sPT4R2KS End of Twitter post  by @guyverhofstadt And Labour said a no-deal exit was \"not viable\" and it would work with other parties to stop it. \"It is testament to the prime minister's failure in these negotiations that the government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table,\" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. And the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for another referendum, said the government was \"attempting to scare\" MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal. \"Theresa May is irresponsibly trying to run down the clock so that the only option is to support her discredited deal,\" Sir Vince Cable said.  MPs will vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations, in the middle of January. The deal will only come into force if both the UK and European parliaments approve it. The BBC understands Mrs May is planning to use the Commons vote as a \"moment of reckoning\" for the Brexit process.  Sources have told the BBC that Downing Street will not stand in the way of MPs who seek to amend the government's motion on the Brexit deal to put forward potential alternatives.  The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to push for a further vote of no-confidence in the government as a whole. On Monday night, the Labour leader tabled a motion calling on MPs to declare they have no confidence in the prime minister because she failed to have a vote on her Brexit deal straight away. No 10 has refused to make time for the motion and Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed on Tuesday that there were under no obligation to do so.  Other parties - the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - have called on Mr Corbyn to push for a no-confidence vote against the government as a whole. Unlike a vote aimed at the prime minister, the government would have to allow a vote on this motion and, if successful, it could force a general election. Northern Ireland's DUP, whose votes the Conservative government has relied on in big votes since the June 2017 election, said they would not support Labour.  Mrs May also appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader.  One of them, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would never vote against Mrs May or a Conservative government. He said on Tuesday evening that he had a \"civilised and courteous\" meeting with the PM, and that the government was \"prudent\" to engage in no-deal planning.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46320368", "content": "It feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent.  On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU.  But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed.  She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it.  But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday.  With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons.  Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens.  But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then?  The default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal.  Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019.  That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK.  If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next. Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on \"how it proposes to proceed\".  The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action.  Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen.  Whatever motion the government brings back to Parliament will now have to be amendable, after MPs backed a change to it tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. MPs are hoping this will allow them to vote to rule-out a no-deal Brexit. The government would find it hard to ignore such a vote - but it would not carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March.  Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal.  As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, \"there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute.\"  But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality.  The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play.  The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons.  Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible.  \"The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different\", Sir David said.  Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs.  Theresa May could try to return to Brussels to renegotiate the Northern Irish \"backstop\" - the main sticking point for many MPs. The government has long insisted this is not an option, because the EU has said the existing deal is final and there is no alternative.  Might Brussels give Mrs May some leeway if she loses the vote by a narrowish margin? Some MPs hope she could get behind another version of Brexit at this point. There is support on the Tory benches for a membership of the European Free Trade Area, which would see the UK staying closely linked to the EU, like Norway. This would not be a straightforward move - and would require extensive renegotiation, even if the EU was prepared to contemplate it, and the extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day. Then there is Labour's proposal for a permanent customs union - Mrs May has always ruled that out, but if enough MPs get behind it, it might be an option, although, again, it would need Article 50 to be extended to allow for more talks. Unlikely, given her track record of doggedly ploughing on against the odds - but if she is defeated by a heavy margin on 11 December she may feel she has no other option. There would then be a Tory leadership contest, which would turn into a fight to the death between the Leave and Remain wings of the party, with profound effects on the future of Brexit and, indeed, the country.  Jacob Rees-Mogg's band of Brexiteers famously failed to reach the magic 48 letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest last month. But if she tries to cling on after a significant defeat on 11 December, more MPs could add their names to the list, forcing a no-confidence vote that she might struggle to win. MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit.  At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton.  But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too.  However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by the Political Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000.  The Electoral Commission's recommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day.  This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks. So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree. This is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected.  But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, \"with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem\" of a deadlocked parliament.  That will be the other critical factor at play.  Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait.  There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later. Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government - Labour has said they will table such a motion if Mrs May loses on 11 December.  This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it. This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in. Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit. Another idea that has been floated is a \"negotiated no deal\" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms.  Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote.  Because Parliament will have to come to a view.  As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: \"We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view.  \"I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament.\"  Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process. Instead, she faces a fraught few days and a vote that will define the country's future for many years.  Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons.  But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.  ", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46393399", "content": "Theresa May survived a leadership challenge but that doesn't mean her problems have gone away. The government delayed the crucial vote on the Brexit deal, originally scheduled for 11 November, because they were going to lose. The PM has been back to Brussels and she still hopes to get \"additional reassurance\" from the EU about the backstop. That's the part of the withdrawal agreement that would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland if no trade agreement is reached between the EU and UK by the end of the \"transition period\". The government now says MPs will get the chance to vote on the deal in the week starting 14 January 2019. The Brexit deal cannot be legally implemented until it has been approved in the House of Commons. What would happen if it was rejected? The EU Withdrawal Act, passed by Parliament in June, sets out some rules. The government would have to produce a new plan of action within 21 days and then allow a further vote within another seven sitting days in the House of Commons.  However, the government could act much more quickly than that. And it's possible that political events would transform the situation. Following a government defeat in the Commons on 4 December, MPs would now have more say in proposing alternatives to any plan of action  - but these would still have to be put into law by the government. There's also been a suggestion that MPs could express their views in a series of \"indicative votes\" on a variety of options. Again, though, these would not be binding. The European Court of Justice has ruled that it would be legal for the UK to unilaterally revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit (without the need for agreement from the other 27 EU countries). With the government still committed to Brexit, it's very likely that a major event such as a further referendum or change of government would have to happen before such a move. In the event that MPs eventually do reject the Brexit deal, some of the most likely options are set out below. If nothing else happens, the default position would be a no-deal Brexit. The law is already in place which means the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. And, in any case, EU rules mean the UK would leave then. The government would probably want to pass some legislation to prepare for no-deal but that's not strictly essential.  If MPs aren't happy with the plan they could try to put pressure on the government to change its mind. Their ultimate sanction, if the government wouldn't budge, would be a vote of no confidence - see section four below. If MPs vote against the deal, the government could propose to negotiate a new Brexit deal. This would not be a question of carrying out minor tweaks and having a second vote. That approach now seems less realistic after the government delayed the vote so Theresa May could go to Brussels and seek clarifications.  Instead, there could be a complete renegotiation that would take some time and might well require an extension of Article 50 to delay Brexit. This would require two key steps. First, the UK would have to make a request to the EU for an extension. This could be granted but only if all EU countries agree at a vote of the EU Council. Alternative ways to break Brexit impasse The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Number crunching: Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? A guide to where we are with Brexit Second, the government would have to table a statutory instrument to change the definition of \"exit day\" in the EU Withdrawal Act. MPs would get a chance to vote on this change. If the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, the government would have to plump for one of the other options instead. Theresa May could decide that the best way out of the deadlock would be to hold an early general election - in order to get a political mandate for her deal. She doesn't have the power just to call an election. But, as in 2017, she could ask MPs to vote for an early election under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. Two-thirds of all MPs would need to support the move. The earliest date for the election would be 25 working days later but it could be after that - the prime minister would choose the precise date. As with the \"renegotiate\" plan, this course of action could also involve a request to the EU to extend Article 50. And it's not the only way an election could come about. If the proposed deal is rejected the opposition could call for a formal vote of no confidence. Mrs May could even call for a vote herself to try to reinforce her authority. The rules, under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, mean there are several possible outcomes if the government loses a formal vote of no confidence. If no government is able to win a vote of confidence within 14 days - and that means neither the existing government nor any alternative - then there would be an early general election. The earliest possible date for the election would be 25 working days later. However, if the government wins a confidence motion within this 14-day period, perhaps by offering some new concession, it carries on. The final possibility is a change of government. That could mean another minority Conservative government with a different prime minister, a coalition government, or a minority government of a different party which had the agreement of others to back it in a confidence vote. Clearly, any new government could have a different Brexit policy so the various options could be re-opened. The government could instead choose to have another referendum. As with a renegotiation or early election, this might well require an extension to Article 50. It's probably already too late to hold a referendum before 29 March. And it can't just happen automatically. The rules for referendums are set out in a law called the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. There would have to be a new piece of legislation to make a referendum happen and to determine the rules, such as who would be allowed to vote. It couldn't be rushed through because there has to be time for the Electoral Commission to consider and advise on the referendum question. The question is then defined in the legislation. Once the legislation has been passed the referendum couldn't happen immediately either. There would have to be a statutory \"referendum period\" before the vote takes place. Experts at University College London's Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps above is about 22 weeks. Even if that could be shortened a little, it would still take us well beyond the end of March. As well as the various options for what could happen with Brexit, there could be a lot of other political events going on as well. Now Theresa May has survived a challenge to her leadership the Conservative Party's rules mean she won't face another for 12 months. But she could always decide to resign anyway if she can't get her deal through and she's not prepared to change course. That would trigger a Conservative leadership campaign which would result in the appointment of a new prime minister. She might also come under pressure to resign if MPs pass a \"censure motion\" - that would be a bit like a no confidence vote but without the same automatic consequences. Again this could lead to a change in prime minister or even a change in government. Whoever ended up in charge would still face the same basic range of Brexit options though. ", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46360310", "content": "\"Sounds like a great deal for the EU,\" is a pretty broad statement.  But President Trump was talking in particular about the prospects for future trade agreements.  \"Right now, if you look at the (Brexit) deal,\" he said, \"they (the UK) may not be able to trade with us, and that wouldn't be a good thing.\" Of course, that shouldn't be taken literally - it doesn't mean no trade at all. But as long as the UK remains in a transition period after Brexit, or in a temporary customs union, it will not be able to implement its own free trade deals, cutting or removing tariffs on goods, with the United States or any other third country.   That much is clear, but trade deals aren't just about tariffs. They are also about rules and regulations (known as non-tariff barriers) which are often more important.  And from an \"America-first\" perspective, it's fair to assume that the president thinks Theresa May's Brexit deal makes it more likely that the UK will stay fairly close to the EU in the long term, by following the same (or very similar) regulations in various sectors of the economy. That is a key point. Because the closer the UK stays to the EU's common rules and standards, the more difficult it will be for it to move closer to the rules and standards followed in the United States.   We're talking here not just about examples which come up regularly, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef (broadly speaking, both are allowed in the US and not in the EU), but also about industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  Many big businesses in the UK want to stay close to all those EU rules (its regulatory framework) because the EU is a huge consumer market right on their doorstep. And they tend to follow the EU rules for their global operations because that simply makes things easier.  The numbers are also instructive here. Last year the UK exported \u00a3274bn of goods and services to the rest of the EU and imported \u00a3341bn. The figures for trade with the United States were \u00a3112bn of exports and \u00a370bn of imports.  So, the EU will remain the UK's most important trading partner for some time to come. And if the president was hoping Brexit would mean a more decisive break between the UK and the EU, he may be disappointed. Hence, \"a great deal for the EU\". There is genuine competition in this field between the United States and the European Union.  The EU may not be a military or diplomatic superpower, but it is a regulatory superpower.  That means one of the big choices the UK will have to make in its negotiations on post-Brexit trade agreements is which regulatory and legal orbit it chooses to operate in.  It's not an absolute \"either-or\" decision, but the UK will have to lean one way or the other.  The non-binding political declaration on future UK-EU trade, approved by EU leaders on Sunday, makes this clear.  The EU is insisting on various \"level playing field\" conditions to ensure that the UK cannot gain a competitive advantage by continuing to have privileged access to the EU market without following its rules.  The political declaration says the level playing field should cover \"state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change and relevant tax matters\", and a separate statement issued by the leaders of the EU27 emphasises that they will \"demonstrate particular vigilance\" to ensure that these conditions are followed to the letter.   The declaration also recognises that the UK will develop an independent trade policy in the future. But it stresses that if the goal is to have frictionless trade with the EU, that will depend on how closely aligned the UK remains with the single market and the customs union.  We're back to the unresolved argument about the right balance between economic access and sovereignty.  So where does that leave the UK's future trade relationship with the US? Downing Street points out that there have already been five working-group meetings to discuss the matter.  But this may not be quite the Brexit that Donald Trump had in mind.

The \"space country\" record, which was written as the star fell in love with her husband, has topped a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News. Janelle Monae's radical, inclusive Dirty Computer came second, while indie star Mitski's Be The Cowboy was third. The top seven were all by female artists, with Cardi B and Ariana Grande rounding out the top five. The full top 20 looked like this: The results were compiled using 35 \"album of the year\" lists published by the most influential magazines, newspapers and blogs in music - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Popsugar and The Times. Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on. Altogether, critics raved about 194 albums, from Kendrick Lamar's blockbuster Black Panther soundtrack to Kamasi Washington's colourful and daring jazz album Heaven & Earth. Variety magazine even picked an unreleased album for its list. Up, by the British alt-rock band Ultimate Painting, was pulled from release in February when the band split up \"due to an irreconcilable breakdown\". But Texan singer Musgraves emerged as the clear winner with her third album, Golden Hour. A swoonsome collection of low-key love songs, it expands the 30-year-old's country sound with dreamy synth textures and unexpected flashes of disco. It was inspired, she said, by artists ranging from Dolly Parton to Daft Punk via Sade and the Bee Gees. End of Youtube post  by KaceyMusgravesVEVO \"I thought there's got to be a world where all these things can live together harmoniously - a place where futurism meets traditionalism,\" Musgraves told Rolling Stone.  \"I still love steel guitar and banjo, but I thought it would be dope if we put that with a vocoder and explored that world. \"The goal for this record was to sound great when you're sitting there at 2AM, thinking about everything.\"  Entertainment Weekly called it \"her most accomplished and least traditional body of work to date\", while The Guardian's Alexis Petridis said: \"You'll be hard pushed to find a better collection of pop songs this year.\" The album, which is up for four awards at next year's Grammys, fared particularly well with US critics, topping \"best of 2018\" lists on Entertainment Weekly, People Magazine and US Weekly, among others. Amongst UK critics, the politicised pop of Christine and the Queens' Chris was the year's most popular album, with punk band Idles taking second place.  But reviewers largely ignored 2018's biggest-selling albums, with only a handful of nominations for Drake's Scorpion, George Ezra's Staying At Tamara's and Post Malone's Beerbongs & Bentleys. Read more about the albums that made the top 10 below: \"We want to punch new holes in the possibilities of music,\" Minnesota band Low told The Guardian earlier this year.   And that's exactly what they do on their 12th album, Double Negative, a glacial, hypnotic record that frequently threatens to disintegrate and collapse on itself. Melodies appear out of static; instruments are stretched and mutilated; distortion threatens to consume entire songs. But then there'll be a sudden moment of quiet clarity, as husband-and-wife Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker's delicate harmonies take centre stage. For a band who were associated with minimalist \"slowcore\" music, it's as dramatic a reinvention as the one Radiohead took on Kid A; with all of that record's oppressive menace. Sparhawk said the music was a visceral, physical response to the first year of Donald Trump's presidency. \"The songs are more desperate, more kind of reaching,\" he said in that same Guardian interview. \"My reaction to a more chaotic world is to fight back with something more chaotic.\"  End of Youtube post  by Sub Pop Five years after the thrilling, radio-friendly riffs of AM, Arctic Monkeys take a detour into eerie, weightless space rock.  It began when Alex Turner grew tired of his guitar (\"as a writing tool I knew where I was going to go with it when I picked it up and that was holding me back\", he told BBC 6 Music's Steve Lamacq) and started picking out tunes on an upright piano in his spare room. Drawing on film noir soundtracks and the tacky glamour of 70s lounge music, the album is alienating at first - but, over time, Turner's meandering stream-of-consciousness gains a peculiar, zonked-out charm. It split opinion amongst fans but, in the long run, it guaranteed the band's continued existence. \"At the risk of tripping myself up and plunging into pretentiousness, I don't know how I could've done anything that would've been more... 'instantly gratifying' than this,\" Turner told Q Magazine.  \"I really can't imagine what else I could have done.\" End of Youtube post  by ArcticMonkeysVEVO Kanye West produced five albums in the space of five weeks this summer, but his collaboration with Pusha T was by far the best. Over seven tight, filler-free songs, he barely pauses for breath, whether he's recapping his credentials (If You Know You Know) or staging a vicious takedown of Drake (Infrared). Kanye peppers the album with old blues riffs and soul samples but, under that veneer, the record can be unrelentingly bleak. The cover - a photo of Whitney Houston's drug-filled bathroom - is as tasteless as Pusha's repeated attempts to glorify his former career as a cocaine dealer. But his command of the mic is compelling, even when the subject matter is knotty. \"Listening to Pusha T rap is like watching a skyscraper get built one steel girder at a time,\" said New York Times critic Jon Caramanica.  \"Every step is carefully programmed, every angle is crisp, and the sum total effect is overpowering.\" End of Youtube post  by PushaTVEVO \"There's a pride in my singing / The thickness of a new skin / I am done with belonging,\" sings Heloise Letissier on Comme Si, the opening track of her second album. It's an outsider's reaction to success - in this case, the worldwide embrace of Letissier's debut. Chaleur Humaine, and its themes of gender and queer identity. She doubles down on that message here, subverting female stereotypes, accentuating her masculinity and arguing for women's sexual agency. \"The second album is made with a bit more defiance, because I wanted to be sure people really knew who they met the first time,\" she told The Independent. But she never lets the message get in the way of a killer hook, and fills her (self-produced) album with supple, danceable grooves worthy of Michael Jackson himself. End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Ariana Grande's world turned upside down on 22 May 2017, when a bomber killed 22 of her fans outside a concert in Manchester.  Her fourth album candidly describes the fallout - from Breathin's vivid depiction of a panic attack, to the steely resolve she displays on No Tears Left To Cry and The Light Is Coming (\"to give back everything the darkness stole\"). Pushing against pop convention, half of the tracks are produced by Pharrell Williams, whose skeletal, off-kilter productions that create a wide open space for Grande's soaring vocals. The rest of the album, overseen by Swedish pop maestro Max Martin, is more formulaic; revelling in Grande's romance with comedian Pete Davidson.  Then, three months after Sweetener was released, she issued the post-script, Thank U, Next, which detailed their break-up. End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Robyn emerged from her eight-year hibernation the same, but different. The Swedish star is still making music you can dance and cry to at the same time - but she's traded the armour-plated pop bangers of her previous albums for a series of slow-burning, deconstructed club jams. The tracks are ordered chronologically; tracing the ebb and flow of Robyn's emotions as she dealt with the death of her friend and mentor Christian Falk, and a turbulent period in her relationship with director Max Vitali. Songs are filled with white noise and disorienting rhythms as she reaches out in the dark, trying to reconnect with the world.  That she gets there via the dancefloor is no surprise, and she distils those experiences into a luminous record that's as sticky as the title suggests.  End of Youtube post  by RobynVEVO A former dancer and social media personality, Cardi B arrived at rapping relatively late in the day - but she grasped the opportunity with both hands. \"I used to be a stripper,\" she told James Corden on her recent episode of Carpool Karaoke, \"so when I got really popular on Instagram and I was stripping throughout the United States, I was going around listening to what people were listening to.  \"A lot of people have different styles, so I was like, 'What would be something that people from every coast would love and enjoy?' and it's like 'Boom!'\" But her debut album does more than cherry-pick current rap trends, it's laden with pop hooks (I Like It) and piercingly funny lyrics (Get Up 10), allowing the Bronx-born star to overtake all of her contemporaries. End of Youtube post  by Cardi B Mitski Miyawaki's fifth album is a collection of strange and beguiling vignettes about loneliness and love on the wane. \"I know no-one will save me, I just need someone to kiss,\" she sings on the deceptively upbeat single Nobody. \"Give me one good honest kiss / And I'll be alright.\" The songs are written from the point of view of a \"woman who feels powerless and overcompensates by exercising extreme control on herself and on her environment,\" Mitski told The Outline. \"But [she's] unravelling a little bit because the amount of control she's exercising on to herself maybe isn't healthy or isn't natural.\" Reflecting the protagonist's fracturing psyche, the album crams 14 tracks into just 33 minutes, with Mitski's serrated guitar riffs and mordant lyrics the sole connective tissue. \"Be the Cowboy shows that love and loss can be grand and small at the same time,\" said Sputnik Music. \"That two minutes is more than enough time to melt down emotion into a pure concentrate and nearly drown yourself in it.\" End of Youtube post  by MitskiVEVO \"I am not America's nightmare, I am the American dream,\" sings Janelle Monae on Dirty Computer, an album that is proudly female, black and queer. She sings about sexual bliss on Make Me Feel and Pynk; rages against male oppression on Django Jane; and prays for her country's soul on Americans. \"I wanted to be as bold as possible in making statements around agency, around women's bodies and rights,\" she said. \"[It's about] us taking back the mic and letting you know that you don't own us and we won't be controlled.\" Dirty Computer's euphoric mix of sex and politics feels like a fresh introduction to the star, who'd previously hidden behind the persona of an R&B cyborg - but one thing hasn't changed: Her ability to make you dance.  End of Youtube post  by Janelle Mon\u00e1e On her fourth album, Musgraves escapes the orbit of country music, yet stays true to its roots, with a collection of blissed-up, spaced-out pop songs. The record was written as she fell for her now-husband, Ruston Kelly, who she says opened her mind \"to a kind of love I never really envisioned for myself\". \"I was like, 'Man, I wonder if I'm gonna be able to write. I've never felt like this before,'\" she told The Independent. \"And it actually ended up being kind of the opposite for me. It changed my world, it made me see the world in a more beautiful way.\" \"That kind of inspiration can't be faked,\" said the Boston Globe in its review. \"And Golden Hour has so many similarly enchanting moments it practically glows.\" In lesser hands, Golden Hour's contentedness could be suffocating, but Musgraves has enough lyrical bite to keep things fresh, as well as a pleasingly carefree approach to genre - not least on the disco-country crossover High Horse. \"I was on a giant Bee Gees kick going into this record, I could not quit,\" she told Stereogum. \"And also I love Sade. I was kinda thinking, 'Man, what would it sound like if Sade made a country album?'\" Well, now we know.

Speaking to the BBC following an exclusive playback of a handful of new tracks, Ronson - who recently produced albums for Lady Gaga and Queens of the Stone Age - says the songs have come together with the help of kindred spirits. \"That's kind of what made the collaborators on this record - more so than choosing a person for a musical style - they were all like-minded people, or people who were going through some traumatic personal stuff,\" says Ronson. The 43-year-old producer and DJ has just gone though a divorce from French model and actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume and says it's given him a different approach to his own music, putting lyrics and emotion ahead of the beats. \"I've obviously worked with people and got to work on records where people have an incredible emotional output that goes on their music, like [Amy Winehouse's] Back To Black,\" he says. \"It doesn't always have to be depressing, I tried doing some other music, whatever I could do not to relive Uptown Funk but the only stuff that started to stick was the stuff that moved me and made me feel melancholy.  \"Once I had two or three of those, I started to see all this as an album.\" 11/29 \ud83d\udc94 @MarkRonson pic.twitter.com/fvX2xvCYrj End of Twitter post  by @MileyCyrus Ronson introduced the new tracks, which feature vocal performances from Miley Cyrus, Swedish pop star Lykke Li and newcomer Arkansas singer-songwriter Yebba, as a series of \"sad bangers\" - heavy on emotion but equally serious about filling dance floors. Afterwards, he clarifies: \"Obviously, I didn't invent 'sad bangers', far from it, Don't Leave Me This Way, I Will Survive, the entire outputs of Robyn and Drake and all the emo stuff but it was nice, even if I had to go through some stuff to have a bit of a concept present itself because then otherwise my records don't have a reason to exist. \"I'm not saying that the bad stuff was worth it but [the music] was definitely a positive by-product of that.\" The lead taster track is the futuristic country-tinged Nothing Breaks Like A Heart featuring Cyrus - whose most recent album Younger Now saw her reclaim her folksy Tennessee roots which preceded her current status as a pop superstar.  \"It wasn't an intentional thing,\" says Ronson of the chugging country disco beat and acoustic guitar riff. \"I heard the drawl in her voice and the twang when I saw her live on SNL (Saturday Night Live). My jaw dropped and I became super-fixated about being able to work with her.  \"But we weren't trying to make a Western song. I think with Miley, just the way she wrote the verses and the way the melody came out, came naturally.\" Other voices on the as-yet-untitled record will include newcomer King Princess - a New York-based artist who is being hotly-tipped for a big 2019.  She is also the first signing to Ronson's own Zelig label. \"I'm just a massive fan and love watching her develop with leaps and bounds with everything she puts out,\" he says. \"She just came to Shangri-La (producer Rick Rubin's Malibu studio) where we were hanging out for a week. \"We tried to get it right three or four times and I said, 'This is a great song but give me something from here [Ronson points to his chest], something that hurts and she wrote this song and came back and I was like, 'This is wonderful'.\" A quick visit to Ronson's Wikipedia page shows the impressive list of artists he has worked with since his debut in 1997, but has anybody ever said no to a collaboration? \"Yes, everyone says no at first and then I kind of like wear them down,\" he laughs. In front of an audience of largely music industry people, Ronson joked the new music has arrived as he \"owes the label an album\" but he also claimed young fans are caring less and less about the format. Stats provided by trade body the BPI earlier this year said streaming now accounts for more than half (50.4%) of all music consumption in the UK with a record 1.5 billion streams served in one week last December. In the UK, album sales actually saw a rise, in total, 135.1 million albums were sold, an increase of 9.5%. However, in the US - the world's biggest music market - sales have plummeted. Figures published by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), showed sales dropped by more than 25% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 2017. Joshua Friedlander, the senior vice-president for Strategic Data Analysis for the RIAA told the BBC: \"The changes we're seeing in the market are a reflection of the way fans are listening to music, but ultimately it's up to each artist and his or her label partner to decide how best to release their music - as a body of work in an album or EP, a singles strategy, or a combination of both.  He added: \"While revenues from traditional album formats such as CDs and digital albums have declined in recent years, they are now being more than offset by an increase in revenues from streaming.\"  \"People are going to stream and listen to whatever they want,\" said Ronson. \"But when there's something that really sits together, like a concept - like the new Metro Boomin album - because he's about the people that he's come up with, like 21 Savage and Travis Scott -  that record's come straight in at number one because you know that album sits together. \"People like Solange and Daft Punk can put a record out and you really believe it was made that way. I guess for me it doesn't matter so much whether it's a dying art form because it is the only art form that I know.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Now in its 17th year, the list showcases 2019's hottest new artists. Past winners includes Adele, Sam Smith, Years & Years and Sigrid. This year's selection focuses on solo acts, with only one band in the top 10. It was voted for by 136 critics, broadcasters and DJs, including former nominees Ellie Goulding and Stormzy. For the first time, the list includes an artist who performs in Spanish. Catalan singer Rosal\u00eda has struck gold by fusing flamenco rhythms with the aesthetics of trap and hip-hop, and recently won two Latin Grammys for her breakout hit Malamente. Signed to Sony, she is being promoted as a mainstream act in the UK, rather than being relegated to the ghetto of \"world music\" - a sure sign of Latin pop's increasing significance. Also among the nominees is France-born, London-based rapper Octavian, whose minimal, spacious mixtapes have marked him out as one of the UK's most intriguing talents. His breakout song Party Here even earned a co-sign from Drake - although the 22-year-old was quick to assert his independence. \"It proves that it's all possible, but I don't want anything more from him,\" he told Pitchfork earlier this year. The resurgence in soul is reflected by Mahalia and Ella Mai. The latter is already a breakout star in the US, where her sumptuous single Boo'd Up topped the R&B charts over the summer. It also and earned her two Grammy nominations on Friday, including one in the prestigious song of the year category. The list also includes Irish singer-songwriter Dermot Kennedy, whose expressive voice and heart-wrenching ballads have earned comparisons to Damien Rice and Rag N' Bone Man; and the absurdly catchy indie band Sea Girls.  US singer King Princess has been branded \"an icon for the next generation of queer youth\" for her refreshingly honest, lyrically-led pop songs, while soulful singer-songwriter Grace Carter has just finished her first UK headline tour. Two UK rappers complete the 10-strong list - Flohio from south London and Slowthai from Northampton. BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac said the list was \"filled with incredibly talented people and is a real reflection of where music is heading in 2019\". She added: \"So many of the artists are truly innovating in their fields. It's exciting to champion new music across the BBC and share these artists with the audience.\" Last year's winner Sigrid said topping the list \"helped me so much with reaching a new audience and giving my music some extra exposure on the radio\". This year's top five will be revealed in January on Radio 1 and BBC News, with one artist announced each day from Monday, 7 January. The winner will be revealed on Friday 11 January.

The news first broke via a poster in an Oxfam shop in Streatham - close to the star's childhood home - and one in Glastonbury. Stormzy confirmed the news via a post on Instagram.  He headlined this summer's Wireless Festival and has played Glastonbury festival twice before in the Sonic Tent in 2016 and the Other Stage in 2017.  Last year marked a big breakthrough for UK grime when Boy Better Know headlined the Worthy Farm event's Other Stage.  Stormzy played earlier in the day on the Other Stage and performed a thrilling set, which will undoubtedly have persuaded organisers Michael and Emily Eavis to book him for the main stage. Your Friday night Pyramid headliner is the mighty Stormzy! pic.twitter.com/z2W9xNsxUE End of Twitter post  by @emilyeavis Watched by Katy Perry and Chris Martin, the star delivered hit after hit from his debut album, Gang Signs and Prayer - as well as a snippet of the Grenfell charity single, Bridge Over Troubled Water, which was number one that weekend. Stormzy dedicated the set to his mother, declaring, \"Hey, mumzy, look at your boy now,\" as he surveyed the massive crowd. A poster appeared in the window of the Glastonbury Oxfam shop earlier today.  Angus Lavery, manager of the store, told the BBC he had no idea how the poster first appeared in his shop window. He said: \"The poster appeared at lunchtime.  \"I don't know who put it up but I haven't been told to take it down.\" We\u2019re delighted to announce that Stormzy is confirmed as the first headliner for Glastonbury 2019.

See you there Friday night!\" Other artists rumoured for the 2019 Glastonbury line-up include Madonna, Paul McCartney and Kylie Minogue - but the line-up isn't usually confirmed until much closer to the event.

It's hardly surprising: The record was the UK's best-seller last year, shifting more than 2.5 million copies. Hit records by George Ezra, Adele and Dua Lipa also feature in the Top 50, which was released to coincide with National Album Day. But a closer look at Alexa's most-popular albums reveals behaviour that may concern the music industry. When people use voice commands to stream music, they consistently ask for songs they already know, with new artists largely frozen out of the picture. For instance, Ed Sheeran accounts for three of the top five most-requested records; while there are multiple entries in the Top 50 for stars like Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, Little Mix, and Katy Perry. Just eight of Alexa's top 50 albums were released this year, and only two of those were debuts - Cardi B's Invasion of Privacy and Anne-Marie's Speak Your Mind. By contrast, the Official Charts Company says 16 of this year's best-selling albums are new releases, with three debuts in the Top 40. The Alexa chart highlights a known problem with voice-activated listening - that there's a significant barrier to discovering new music. \"If you're looking at Spotify on your phone or your computer a lot of stuff is presented to you, so you might go, 'Oh, so-and-so's got a new album out, I'll give that a go'\" says Mark Sutherland, editor of Music Week. \"But if all the decision-making is put upon you, and you have to tell Alexa what to choose, then inevitably you're likely to go for tried-and-trusted, more familiar music.\" Amazon Music's head of programming, Alex Luke, acknowledged the problem at last week's Music Week Tech Summit in London. \"It's one of the things we've realised as we've been forging this path into voice - discovery is a challenge for unknown artists,\" he said.  Notably, albums like Michael Jackson's Thriller, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell are well-represented in Alexa's most-requested list; upending the convention that streaming services favour current hits over the classics.  Compilation albums were excluded from the chart, Amazon said, otherwise The Greatest Showman soundtrack would have topped the list. One of the main challenges for voice-activated discovery of new music on smart speakers is the user's lack of knowledge about what to ask for. And let's face it: Even if people do ask for the right thing, many speakers sadly still struggle to get that right and default to Ed, Adele or Taylor Swift - which only skews personalisation algorithms further into thinking that's what you actually want to hear. But it is actually personalisation that is the key to surfacing new music on smart speakers. Much like traditional radio they need to sandwich in new tracks between the classics, based on what they know you like.  The more these voice assistants know about you the more they can properly cater for your needs and preferences. We're a little way off yet, but I've no doubt they'll all crack that soon.  The issue of music discovery is a big concern for record labels and musicians alike; especially as voice-activated speakers are one of the UK's fastest-growing consumer products. About 5 million UK adults now have a smart speaker at home, according to Ipsos Mori; while research from the US says that 90% of owners use the devices listen to music at least once a week, and they are poised to overtake mobile phones as the most common way of accessing their favourite songs. Amazon is the market leader, with its Alexa-enabled devices accounting for about 65% of all smart speakers sold in the UK. However, says Sutherland, \"the most commonly-asked question to Alexa is 'play music'\".  \"So until Alexa evolves to the stage where she suggests things to you, instead of you suggesting things to her, it's going to be hard to get people to say, 'Alexa, play me this person. I'm not sure who they are or what the record is called because it's brand new'.  \"That's an unlikely scenario in your kitchen.\" Amazon hopes to encourage listeners to try new music through its \"Weekly One\" feature - which promotes a new song by an emerging artist every week.  There's also a UK Rising playlist that showcases new music; and a feature that allows users to request \"the most popular songs in Manchester\" and other UK cities. For now, though, Ed Sheeran reigns supreme. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The career-spanning set came straight off the back of their Live at the BBC special - which airs on BBC Two on Friday night from 23:05 - and we went along to witness the start of the new Monkeys era for ourselves. Here's what we learned. They've been living as Transatlantic rock stars for many years but until now the Arctics have remained a tight and compact rock machine. But the expansive sound of the new record required no fewer than nine accomplished musicians - from the likes of LA band Mini Mansions - who came and went throughout the night, providing supplementary guitar, keys and percussion where required (mostly heavily on the new material). Only Cameron Avery of Tame Impala and The Last Shadow Puppets (touring member) received an actual name-check, however, ahead of his contribution to new song She Looks Like Fun. While the Arctics used to want to block out the rest of the world (bar the odd cameo from the likes of Dizzee Rascal and Miles Kane) their 2018 incarnation has apparently flung the stage door wide open. The opening track from the new record got its debut run-out - as the first part of a three-song encore. The song's refrain: \"Who you gonna call? The Martini police\" echoed around the venue just minutes after the band themselves had returned to the stage with their glasses full of clear liquid. The new songs showed the band in a whole new light as frontman Alex Turner, complete with goatee, moved effortlessly from guitar to piano stool and back again. All six of the band's albums were represented on the night - with five songs apiece from Tranquillity Base and AM - and the expanded band helped breathe fresh life into the old indie bangers too. With five years between records, it seems the Monkeys had time to reflect on where they've been before setting off in a vastly new direction. Apart from watching them get to grips with their new sound on British soil for the first time, perhaps the most excitement came from seeing them re-visit a few old lesser-played (non-single) favourites. Matt Helders' opening drum beat on Do Me A Favour from 2007 album Favourite Worst Nightmare drew loud cheers and the haunting Pretty Visitors from 2009's Humbug - despite having been performed recently - remained a most welcome and less obvious addition. \"All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms / And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall.\" By some distance though, the shock inclusion of their northern street poet night-out anthem, From the Ritz to the Rubble, from their 2006 debut album provided the highlight of the evening. Played for the first time since 2011, it caused riotous scenes in the 5,300 strong crowd and almost took the Royal Albert Hall's expensively-adorned roof off.

Tickets for Thursday's sold out gig retailed at around \u00a360 with a chunk of that cash acting as a voluntary donation to the War Child charity, which provides assistance to kids in areas experiencing conflict. A quick stroll around the venue however, saw hardcore Monkeys fans being asked by scalpers to pay upwards of \u00a3100 for the pleasure. The band's management, who worked closely with Fanfair Alliance, told the BBC that they are making every effort to combat secondary ticket touting. They said: \"In anticipation of the demand, we adopted strict Anti-Touting measures. Ticket resale was forbidden other than through the authorised 'Face value or less' ethical exchange. \"Of course, despite such efforts a very limited number of touts may try to sell the 'guest' ticket but will have to walk the buyer in to deal with the ID restriction limiting greatly their success.\" Adding: \"The measures adopted to fairly distribute tickets and to restrict their resale were very successful.\" \"Thank you for coming. And thank you for supporting war child\", noted singer Alex, before the band's raucous final track of the night. \"I've just got one final question for you? R U Mine?\" Perhaps a better question might have been: \"R we going to stop these touts once and for all?\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The Manchester bomb, which killed 22 people after her gig last May, looms large, as does her blossoming relationship with fiance Pete Davidson. The 25-year-old also has much to say about anxiety, internet outrage and female empowerment. There are appearances by Pharrell, Nicki Minaj and Missy Elliott - although none can top the cameo by Madonna as the voice of God. Here is a track-by-track breakdown. 1. Raindrops (An Angel Cried) This 37-second blast of bare vocal power introduces the album, and is a cover of part of a 1964 LP track titled An Angel Cried by The Four Seasons. She said she woke up with it in her head one day while she was finishing the album and went on to discover a personal connection with the song. \"This is so crazy, y'all are going to think I'm lying,\" she told US TV host Jimmy Fallon in May. \"But my grandfather's best friend, who I grew up hanging out with, Charlie Calello, wrote it with Bob Gaudio from The Four Seasons. And that gave me goosebumps.\" 2. Blazed (featuring Pharrell Williams) Jumping with Pharrell's trademark bouncy production, the pair's vocals go back and forth on this love song. About half the tracks on the album are produced by Pharrell, and Swedish uber-producer Max Martin worked on the other half. 3. The Light Is Coming (featuring Nicki Minaj) This bubbling, twitching track seems to be a comment on the age of constant, instant judgement and criticism from people with - as she has explained - \"their loud ass opinions making them deaf to others and the light\". A sample of a man saying \"You wouldn't let anybody speak\" runs over and over in the background - which is taken from CNN footage of a man shouting at a senator at a town hall meeting in 2009. It's Ariana's fifth collaboration with Minaj, who she turned to after trying eight other rappers. Nicki called her at 05:00 one morning to listen to the verse. \"I went in my slippers and pyjamas to the studio and she killed it,\" Ariana told Fader. 4. REM This is about a relationship that blurs between the dreamworld and reality, and Ariana has said the story behind the song is \"dreaming someone into your life\". This title refers to rapid eye movement sleep rather than being a tribute to the 1990s band. She also recently said it's her favourite song on the album. 5. God Is a Woman This stand-out track cleverly combines a big message about female empowerment with a very personal, sultry story about the power a women holds over a lover. The video has lashings of loaded imagery - she swivels as a galaxy spins around her hips like a hula-hoop, sits calmly as tiny men literally hurl insults at her, and straddles the globe half naked as her fingers toy with the clouds below. At one point, dressed in sexy warrior garb, including leather gloves with the word \"Power\" written on them, she mouths along as Madonna recites an adapted version of Samuel L Jackson's Pulp Fiction Bible speech. The voice of the Queen of Pop says: \"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my sisters. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\" The original speech uses the word \"brothers\" - Ariana and Madonna have changed that to \"sisters\", of course. 6. Sweetener Ariana has said the album's title track was the first song she wrote for the album sessions two years ago. The name Sweetener refers to the message that you can make something good from a bad situation.  \"When you're handed a challenge, instead of sitting there and complaining about it, why not try to make something beautiful?\" she told Time magazine. 7. Successful The Guardian's album review describes this as \"ostensibly frothy\" but says it \"shifts and twists unexpectedly in a way that suggests someone behind it is conversant with the work of 70s soul's more expansive melodists\". That will be Pharrell. In June, Ariana tweeted that the song is about women celebrating each other and feeling good about \"their own individual success\". 8. Everytime  This formulaic filler is about going back to a love that's probably best kept in the past.  \"I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it,\" Ariana sings. Um, who else can relate? 9. Breathin Despite its upbeat tempo, Ariana explained that the track is actually about anxiety. \"You know when you feel like you can't get a full breath? It's like the worst feeling in the world,\" she told US TV host Jimmy Fallon. \"So it's a song about that feeling.\" End of Youtube post  by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon She said she was having lots of anxiety attacks, including one in the recording studio. \"We made a pop song out of it,\" she said. 10. No Tears Left to Cry End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo The first song to be released from the album in April, this was widely interpreted as an anthem of healing and hope in the wake of the Manchester bomb. It doesn't take long for the initial sombre tone to be dispelled as both pace and mood rise up and she repeats: \"I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up.\" That sums up her public approach to Manchester - she respectfully acknowledged what happened last May but is keen to send an optimistic message and carry on living her life. There's a further nod to Manchester in the video when a bee - the city's emblem dating back to the workers of the industrial revolution - buzzes away in the final scene. 11. Borderline (featuring Missy Elliott) Ariana has said she's dreamed of working with Missy Elliott since she was a kid, when she would dance round her bedroom to Missy's music. In June, the legend tweeted how \"grateful\" she was to be part of the album. USA Today's review said the song's only fault is \"that the rapper's feature isn't twice as long\". 12. Better Off On Apple Music, the editors' notes say this ballad is about exiting a toxic relationship. \"I'm better off not being around ya,\" she sings. It has been rumoured that the track is about Ariana's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller. The singer has previously spoken about her \"toxic relationship\" with Miller. 13. Goodnight n Go Ariana has said \"both of my idols\" blessed this album. One is Madonna. The other? Cult British singer-songwriter Imogen Heap. Goodnight n Go is a cover and a reworking of Heap's song Goodnight And Go, which appeared on her 2005 album Speak For Yourself. End of Youtube post  by ImogenHeapVEVO Ariana recently described Imogen, who combines experimental, atmospheric production with dripping emotion, as \"my number one fave artist of all time/the woman who inspires my every move\". She invited Imogen - who also wrote the music for the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child stage play - to perform at the One Love Manchester concert last June. 14. Pete Davidson There's not much detective work required to work out what this brief song is about. It's a very public declaration of love for the comedian and actor, who she started dating in May and got engaged to the following month. \"I know you know that you're my soulmate, and all that,\" she sings. 15. Get Well Soon The finale sees her open up about her anxiety again. \"When I got home from tour, I had really wild dizzy spells, this feeling like I couldn't breathe,\" she told Elle. \"I would be in a good mood, fine and happy, and they would hit me out of nowhere. I've always had anxiety, but it had never been physical before. There were a couple of months straight where I felt so upside down.\" She told Pharrell about it, and they wrote Get Well Soon, which she describes as \"all the voices in my head talking to one another\". The song finishes with 40 seconds of silence, taking its running time to 5:22 - the date of the Manchester attack in the US date format.

No self-respecting pop album is now complete without a \"sadbanger\" - a song you can cry and dance to at the same time - in the vein of Robyn's Call Your Girlfriend or With Every Heartbeat. Artists like Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan and (especially) Carly Rae Jepsen have built careers out of her fusion of tenderness and club beats. Katy Perry called her \"the epitome of effortless cool\" and when Lorde performed on Saturday Night Live last year, she put a framed photograph of Robyn on her piano, explaining that Dancing On My Own had inspired the tone of her second album, Melodrama. \"It's happy and sad, fiery and independent but vulnerable and small, joyous even when a heart is breaking,\" she wrote on Tumblr. \"It's just perfect.\" All this attention, however, gave Robyn the heebie-jeebies. \"I was reluctant to be a role model,\" she says carefully. \"I really didn't feel comfortable in that position for a long time.\" End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Her concern was that being venerated could limit her horizons. \"It becomes weird. You're expected to do things because you're role model. But it has to be that you're doing things because you want to. That's how you become an example in the first place.\" Robyn has fiercely protected her independence ever since her mid-20s, when she extricated herself from a punitive US recording contract. She'd been a teen star in the late 1990s, scoring a global hit with the song Show Me Love. But her label refused to release her second album in the US - partly because she insisted on including two songs about abortion.  \"My record company thought I was crazy,\" she told the BBC in 2007. \"They were like: 'Why don't you just do what Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears are doing?' \"I understand that but I wanted to do my own thing. I make really commercial music but I still want to be able to explore a more radical way of expression. So it took time for me to find a place.\" She took back control in 2004, buying back the rights to her demos and setting up her own label, Konichiwa Records, in Sweden. People told her she'd lose money, she says, \"but it was really my salvation\". For the next six years, she worked non-stop - writing, touring, remixing, promoting and recording; culminating with 2010's ambitious Body Talk project, a three-volume anthology of laser-blaster pop, recorded and released in the space of just six months. Then Robyn disappeared... well almost. There were a clutch of EPs with Royksopp, Mr Tophat and her side project La Bagatelle Magique; but nothing captured the adrenaline rush of a Robyn solo record. Her vanishing act was prompted by a period of painful personal change. She split from her long-term partner, video director Max Vitali (they later reunited), and lost her musical mentor Christian Falk to pancreatic cancer.   At the same time, she started an intense course of psychoanalysis to help navigate the impact of childhood fame and her parents' divorce. \"I was slowly getting myself back into a space where I could make music again,\" she reflects. From the outset, she knew a new album had to sound and feel different. \"It's so easy to fall into old patterns and behaviours and things you feel safe in,\" she told me in 2015 as work on the record began.  \"But I don't feel safe any more in being safe.  There's always a time for change. I don't know exactly where that's going to lead me.\" After the upheavals in her personal life, she knew \"the emotional tone I wanted to reach\" would be \"soft and vulnerable and open\" but says it took time to locate it. \"I knew what I wanted to do, but I didn't know how to do it - so I really had to go back to school. I went clubbing a lot. I changed how I was writing. I learned new software. I was listening to a lot of disco.\" You can hear her evolution in progress by seeking out the different incarnations of album's title track Honey (\"there's enough for a full album of different versions\" Robyn says). A demo she played on Radio 1 earlier this month is delicate and abstract; while a later attempt, which appeared on Lena Dunham's TV show Girls, recalls the squelchy basslines and sequenced synths of Body Talk. But the final (and best) version is sensual and dreamlike, thrumming hypnotically as Robyn promises:  \"You're not gonna get what you need / But baby, I have what you want / Come get your honey\". End of Youtube post  by RobynVEVO In some ways, those lyrics were a message to her fans - because Honey, the album, doesn't delivers the immediate pop fix they demanded.  Liberated from the constraints of verse-chorus song structures, Robyn's new music is stretched out and imperfect; reflecting the singer's years-long process of grief and self-excavation.  What does it means to be human, she asks? To live through loss? To preserve yourself without shutting down? Amplifying Robyn's emotional instability, the music constantly shifts and mutates. A bass line will appear in a different time signature to the rest of the song, slipping in and out of sync, casting the singer adrift. \"Those uneven periods of rhythm felt good in my body,\" she says. \"They're more potent. They give you a more trance experience than others. And that's what I wanted to dance to.\" It's impossible to overstate the importance that dancing holds for Robyn. At home she practices samba, finding it so moving that \"it makes me cry\". In the steamy haze of a nightclub, dancing becomes a spiritual, restorative act.  \"The after hours, when people have been going for ever and ever and ever - there's a kind of dancing that happens then that's not so self-aware, that's really about losing yourself to the music,\" she says. Fittingly, her album pivots around a dancefloor epiphany. After mourning Falk on Missing U and reconciling with Vitali on Baby Forgive Me, she finds resolve in the hypnotic beats of Send To Robin Immediately, declaring: \"If you got somebody to love, give that love today / Know you got nothing to lose, there's no time to waste.\" From there, the mood lightens as Robyn gets giddy on the 90s throwback Between The Lines and kicks back on the ultra-chilled Beach2k20. And the album ends with something totally unexpected: A Robyn song with happy chords, happy lyrics and a happy melody. \"Never gonna be broken hearted / Ever again,\" she sings on Ever Again. \"I'm only gonna sing about love / Ever again.\" So is that her current state of mind? \"I think I'm in a good place,\" she says hesitantly. \"I don't know what happy means, but maybe happy?  \"More positive. I feel good about things and, musically, I'm able to go in all kinds of directions now because I feel like I've gotten rid of a lot of filters.\" In fact, she's even come to terms with being a role model.  \"I definitely embrace it now. It's very touching when people say they've been inspired by stuff I've done.  \"And I understand the point of it: It's really important to have female role models - or any kind of role model you can recognise yourself in.\" Honey is out now.

The R&B star's first three albums form a pointed dialogue about freedom, class, and acceptance - albeit in a futuristic, sci-fi setting. Her latest record, though, is firmly rooted in the present day, with the star responding to the political and social upheavals in the US. \"There were a lot of times I would stop recording [and] I would be deeply upset, angry,\" she told BBC Radio 1. \"Living over in America and feeling like the people I love were pushed to the margins of society by the leader of the free world and that regime. \"You do have to stand up for those who can't often stand up for themselves - so I do feel a responsibility to knock the hell out of the bully.\" The star set out her stall with the album's first single, Django Jane, a bold, street-smart banger packed with political and feminist discourse. \"They been trying hard just to make us all vanish,\" she raps at one point. \"I suggest they put a flag on a whole 'nother planet\". The star said she'd recorded the song as a \"response to the sting of feeling like my rights as a young black woman... are constantly being trampled on\". \"I'm angry at many of the things that I hear coming out of the mouths of people in the position of power,\" she told Annie Mac. \"I'm tired of the abuse of power. I'm tired of so many things.  \"But at the end of the day, I do believe that we are on a shift change. Women are uniting, we're realising we're stronger together, we're more powerful together, that we really can get [things] done when we are aligned - and so Django Jane was important to say that.\" The star isn't just making these statements in her lyrics. Django Jane feels like a companion piece to her recent screen roles in Moonlight and Hidden Figures, while Monae's Fem The Future movement predates both Me Too and Time's Up. The star also addressed sexual inequality with an impassioned speech at this year's Grammy Awards, telling the gathered executives: \"We come in peace, but we mean business.\" Looking back on the moment, she remembers feeling \"nervous but eager\" about taking a stand.  But her speech was quickly overshadowed by Grammy chief Neil Portnow who, asked about the lack of female winners at the ceremony, commented that women \"need to step up\". Monae counters that the industry needs \"systemic\" and \"structural\" changes to promote and protect women. \"It's not like we don't have the talent to be music producers or engineers or run record labels,\" she told Radio 1.  \"It's the lack of opportunity, it's the lack of hiring, it's the lack of having women present in these rooms helping make these decisions. \"Statistics already show that when women are in positions of power, sexual harassment go down immensely. \"We really are going to have to have conversations - not just as women, but the men are going to have to have these conversations with us, \"They're going to have to ally up with us, they're going to have to check each other in these boys' club rooms, they're going to have to stand up for us in ways that I don't think they have.  \"And this is not to group all men together - 'cause not every man is the problem - but you need to recognise the problem and be unafraid to check the problem.\" Monae has promoted her new album, Dirty Computer, with a dramatic trailer attached to Marvel's blockbuster superhero film Black Panther.   But the first taste of the music came at a private listening party last week.  Dressed in her trademark black and white, the 32-year-old took over a bar in central London, dancing her way through a crowd of specially-invited guests, and pulling some (mostly) willing volunteers up to gyrate alongside her. The event showcased the fun side of the album, which sees Monae exploring sexual liberation as often as her politics, channelling the spirit of her mentor and former collaborator, Prince. \"Having his support and his belief and his confidence meant everything to me,\" she told Annie Mac.  \"He never tried to encourage me to be like him, or to write music like him. It was always, 'You have something special. I'm here if you need me, but I love what it is that you do.'\" But she also confessed to being frightened by the star's stage presence as a child. \"Prince, you know growing up, was always other-worldly to me, to a point where I was scared of him.  \"When I would see his videos on TV they would make me very scared and mainly because I just had never seen a black man express himself in the way that Prince did. He was so free.  \"And maybe it was because I was scared of myself. Maybe it was like something that I saw in him that I wasn't ready to tap into and I think it's that freedom. \"You got that when you looked at him, when you listened to him.\" The single Make Me Feel, released at the same time as Django Jane, sounds like Monae's tribute to Prince - full of choppy guitar licks and wibbly 80s synths, with lyrical nods to the star's free, and fluid, exploration of sexuality. Monae says her aim with the album is to celebrate people who've been \"pushed to the margins of society\".  \"I wanted to make an album for all the dirty computers of the world,\" she said. \"Those who are told that they have bugs and viruses, that they need to fix themselves, that they need to clean themselves.  \"Dirty computers [should] see their bugs and viruses as attributes, as features, as characteristics that help make society great and inclusive. \"Great art comes when we're able to all come together. That's where the magic happens, that's where you start understanding one another.  \"And if you're understanding, you start liking each other, and through liking, you start uniting.\" Dirty Computer will be released on 27 April.

Now the Recording Academy has revealed the nominees for the 2019 Grammy Awards. It's a year of upheaval, with several major artists overlooked in favour of fresh, new, agenda-setting talent. The Grammys aren't exactly known for their brevity; and this year's list of nominees runs to 84 categories across a rainforest-destroying 55 pages.  Matters haven't been helped by the decision to expand the marquee categories - album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and best new artist - to eight nominees, instead of the traditional five. The idea was to improve diversity , following criticism that only one female artist (Lorde) was nominated for best album last year; and that genres like jazz and classical were being overlooked.  Not that you'll actually find any jazz or classical in those categories in 2019 but, hey, it's the thought that counts. Instead, the extra slots give exposure to some lesser-known artists including R&B star H.E.R; experimental vocal group Chloe x Halle; and retro rock band Greta Van Fleet - who are the only guitar-led act to feature in the main categories. He didn't even have an album out this year, but Kendrick Lamar wins eight nominations thanks to the soundtrack for Black Panther, which he curated and produced at the start of 2018. The single All The Stars, featuring the Compton-born rapper his label-mate SZA, is up for both record and song of the year; while the album itself becomes the first movie soundtrack to be nominated for album of the year since 2002. Back then, it was the Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou that secured a nomination - and it went on to win the main prize. Can King Kendrick do the same? Over the years, Beyonce and Jay-Z have had multiple opportunities to practice their \"gracious loser\" face at the Grammys - with neither artist winning best album, despite multiple nominations. \"What does Beyonce have to do to win album of the year,\" asked a mystified Adele at the podium in 2017, having just beaten the star's Lemonade record to the main prize. This year, though, it got worse: The couple's joint album Everything Is Love failed to secure a nomination in any of the big four categories.  Maybe Jay-Z's attack on the Recording Academy made voters uncomfortable (\"please inform the Grammys that the 0-for-8 situation is unacceptable,\" he says, in slightly more colourful language, on the single Apes***).   The record still gets a couple nods in the urban and video categories - but that raises the question of whether the couple, who've historically been a front-row fixture at the ceremony, will see fit to boycott the event?  Kanye and Drake have done it in the past... but we'd be gutted to miss another moment like this. With Bodak Yellow, Cardi B became the first female rapper to top the US charts without a featured artist since Lauryn Hill in 1998. That song's success earned her two Grammy nominations last year - putting her out of contention for best new artist this year - but she's cleaned up in five other categories. Her critically-acclaimed debut album, Invasion of Privacy, is up for best rap album and album of the year; while her Latin-flavoured party anthem I Like It is a strong contender for record of the year.  She might not win them all, but as she summarises on Best Life: \"Went from small-ass apartments to walking red carpets / I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ay?\" She's one of pop's biggest stars but Ariana Grande has never won a Grammy. That could change this year, with her cathartic, confessional Sweetener album up for best pop record and the single God Is A Woman up for best pop vocal. But it's a surprise to see her omitted from the big four categories, given the emotional and cultural impact she's had over the past year.  Even more unusual is the total absence of No Tears Left To Cry, her uplifting response to the Manchester Arena bombings, from the nominations list. Taylor Swift is a darling of the Grammys, with 10 wins under her belt - including two album of the year awards. But the Academy has no love for her Reputation album, which gains a single nomination in the pop category.   The signs were there last year, when the record's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, failed to secure a nomination - but after selling two million albums, breaking YouTube records and staging the highest-grossing tour of 2018, many assumed Swift would walk away with a clutch of nominations. It wasn't to be - but voters beware. Swift buries hatchets, but she keeps maps of where she put 'em.  The holder of precisely zero top 40 singles in the UK, Kacey Musgraves is nonetheless one of the biggest stars in her home country. The Texas native wrote songs for Martina McBride and Miranda Lambert before getting a deal with Mercury Records in 2012 - but her new album, Golden Hour, tweaks the traditions and challenges the conventions of country music. A leisurely, sensual and emotionally-candid record, it was written with one question in mind: \"If Sade made a country album, what would it sound like?\" For the crime of dispensing with tradition, Musgraves was frozen out by the small-minded, conservative world of US country radio, receiving almost no airplay - which made it all the more surprising (and gratifying) when she picked up album of the year at the recent Country Music Awards. That sets her up for a successful Grammys where voters are likely to respond to Golden Hours' timeless melodies and effortless charm. There were plenty of political moments at the 2018 Grammys - Kendrick Lamar rapping about black power, Kesha addressing the #MeToo movement and Camila Cabello's poignant speech about immigration. But the awards themselves played it safe - rewarding Bruno Mars's airbrushed R&B at the expense of Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar. This year could be different, with Childish Gambino's powerful and singular This Is America nominated for both song and record of the year. The song's brutally compelling video, meanwhile, is surely the only real contender for video of the year. There could also be recognition for Dirty Computer - a bold and funky album from Janelle Monae that tackles identity politics, gender fluidity, discrimination and the battle for America's soul. Responding to her nomination on Friday morning, the singer said: \"This album is so much bigger than me. It's not about me, it's about marginalised voices. \"Being a young black queer voice in America, there was something I had to say, and people I had to represent. I hope they feel loved and I hope they feel celebrated.\" Guns N' Roses could win their first ever Grammy for the deluxe edition of 1987's Appetite for Destruction - an album which didn't receive a single nomination the year it was released. Post Malone was barred from competing in the rap field because his album doesn't contain enough rapping. He was also ruled out of the best new artist category for being too popular! Kanye West - one of hip-hop's most innovative and respected producers - receives his first ever nomination in the producer of the year category for the sequence of five albums he worked on this year - including Pusha T's Daytona, Teyana Taylor's KTSE and his own record, Ye. Drake is back! After withholding his More Life mixtape from consideration last year, he's all over the 2019 nominations list with his attention-sapping double album Scorpion.  Dua Lipa and Jorja Smith are the first British stars to be nominated for Best New Artist since James Bay in 2016. The soundtrack to A Star Is Born was released after the eligibility period - but one song, Shallow, was released as a single days before the deadline, and earned nominations for both record of the year (recognising everyone who worked on the track) and song of the year (which goes to the writers). It's likely to be a big Oscar contender, too. Sting and Shaggy get a nomination for best reggae album for their weird-but-not-awful-but-still-what-were-they-thinking collaboration 44/876.

That's the equivalent of everyone in the country playing 1,036 tracks, or almost three continuous days of music, on sites like Apple Music and Spotify.  A huge proportion of those streams were of Ed Sheeran - who had four of the Top 10 biggest singles of the year. Trade body the BPI says streaming now accounts for more than half (50.4%) of all music consumption in the UK. The figure is up from 36.4% last year - with a record 1.5 billion streams served in one week last December.  To put that in context, we are now streaming more songs in a single week than we did in the first six months of 2012. If anything, though, the BPI is actually underplaying the success of streaming, as it relies on data from the Official Charts Company, which does not currently count music played on YouTube towards its figures. It has been estimated that if YouTube was included, the number of streams accessed by music fans in the UK would double. Overall, sales of music generated \u00a31.2 billion for the UK economy last year, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. In total, 135.1 million albums were sold last year, (including 68 million \"streaming equivalent albums\" - where 1,000 streams counts as one \"sale\"), an increase of 9.5%. Vinyl continued to grow in popularity, with 4.1 million LPs purchased in 2017.  Again, Ed Sheeran was the most popular artist on the format - closely followed by Liam Gallagher and Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, which featured in the top five vinyl albums for the third year in a row. However, vinyl only accounts for 3% of the overall music market, and its success is in stark contrast to the decline in CDs and downloads. CD sales, which peaked at 162.4 million in 2004, now languish at 41.6 million.  Digital downloads are also on the way out, with just 13.8 million albums bought on stores like iTunes and Amazon last year, a drop of 23%. Overall, music consumption was up by 8.7% - the fastest rise since 1998.  Sales and streams contributed \u00a31.2 billion to the UK economy, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA). Apart from Sheeran, the UK's biggest artists included Rag N Bone Man, whose album Human shifted more than 885,000 copies by the end of the year.  Little Mix's Glory Days continued to sell well, while Pink and Drake were the best-selling international artists. It was also a better year for new artists after a dismal 2016, where only one British debut album (Bradley Walsh's Chasing Dreams) went gold. 2017 saw the likes of Dua Lipa, Stormzy, Harry Styles and J Hus achieve the 100,000 sales milestone. Overall, the entertainment industry enjoyed a bumper year in 2017, with sales of video games, films, TV programmes, and music all recording growth for the fifth consecutive year. Disney had the two biggest-selling film titles of the year - with the live action remake of Beauty And The Beast and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story collectively selling more than 2.9 million copies, according to the British Association for Screen Entertainment. DVDs and Blu-Rays both saw a double-digit decline in sales, but revenues from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon grew by 22.2%, and now account for more than 70% of the video market. According to ERA, the entertainment market as a whole reached a \"new all-time-high\", generating \u00a37.24 billion last year. CEO Kim Bayley called it \"an historic result\" driven by new technology and innovation.  \"New digital services are bringing ever increasing numbers of the UK population back to entertainment with 24/7 access to the music, video and games they want,\" she said.

The 24-year-old had been due to collect the Ultimate Choice Award at the ceremony in person. But within minutes of the show's start, presenter Victoria Justice said Miley wasn't going to make it after all. Writing on Instagram later, Miley said her absence was down to creating \"an unrealistic schedule\" for herself. \"To my dearest fans, I want to say thank you from the very bottom of my heart for presenting me with the Ultimate Choice Award!\" the singer said in a post which made full use of the exclamation mark. \"I am beyond bummed I couldn't make it to the show. I had every intention of being there to accept and celebrate this honour!\" Not so bummed, however, that she couldn't use the same post to plug her new single. In an announcement she'd presumably been planning to make at the ceremony, she revealed the release date for her new track Younger Now. \"I look forward to making music for the rest of my life and I'm thankful everyday for those who listen!\" she said. \"I am sending so much love and peace into the world right now because that's what we need most.\" Previous winners of the Ultimate Choice prize include Selena Gomez, Ashton Kutcher and Taylor Swift. The big winners at this year's ceremony, held in Los Angeles, included Wonder Woman, Finding Dory, Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, which took home the major film prizes.

The nominations for Lamar, who swept last year's ceremony, are for his work on the Black Panther soundtrack. Canadian rapper Drake is up for song of the year for God's Plan and album of the year for Scorpion. Dua Lipa, Jorja Smith and Ella Mai are among the Brits on the nominations list, which was revealed in full on Friday. \"Two Grammy nominations, I'm so happy but I can't stop crying, I can't believe it!\" tweeted Dua.  The British-Kosovan pop star's nods are for best new artist and best dance recording for Electricity, a collaboration with Silk City, Diplo and Mark Ronson. Meanwhile, London-born Ella Mai is nominated for song of the year and best R&B song for Boo'd Up, which reached number five in the US Billboard Hot 100 earlier this year. The song helped her become the first Brit to top the US R&B chart since 1992. Jorja Smith, from Walsall, is up for the Grammy for best new artist, following her Mercury Prize nomination and her Brit Awards Critics' Choice win. Arctic Monkeys, Jon Hopkins, Disclosure, Seal and Mark Ronson are among the other British nominees. Elsewhere, folk singer Brandi Carlile has six nods, while Lady Gaga, Cardi B and Childish Gambino each have five. Ariana Grande receives two nominations - one for best pop vocal album (Sweetener), and best pop solo performance (God is a Woman). One of the most notable snubs is for Taylor Swift - whose album Reputation received only one nod, for best pop vocal album.  Four of the major categories were expanded this year, to allow for more recognition for women and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) artists. Song and album of the year are among the categories which will now have eight nominees, instead of five. The change comes after the Recording Academy created a diversity task force in response to criticism that the winners are usually disproportionately white and male. The categories which have been expanded are album of the year, record of the year (for best overall song), song of the year (which is specifically for songwriting) and best new artist. The other categories will continue to include five nominees. Bruno Mars swept last year's awards and caused something of an upset when he won the album of the year prize over Kendrick Lamar.

Aged just 21, she is one of the youngest ever artists to receive the honour - beaten only by Adele, who was 19 when she topped the 2008 list. \"It's a huge honour,\" she told the BBC. \"I don't know how to explain it.\" Influenced by Lorde, Robyn and Joni Mitchell, the star has become known for catchy, quirky and literate pop songs.  BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac called her \"literally the perfect pop star\" and \"an absolute pleasure to play on the radio\". The Sound of 2018 list was compiled using votes from 173 DJs, critics and festival bookers. For the first time, this year's panel also included former nominees, including Stormzy, Ellie Goulding, Years & Years frontman Olly Alexander and last year's winner, Ray BLK. The top five was a mixture of British and international, and unsigned and signed acts - all of whom were aged 22 or younger.  Emotive singer-songwriter Rex Orange County came second, while urban jazz act IAMDDB was third. Taught to play piano at an early age, Sigrid didn't consider writing her own music until she was 16, when her brother demanded she stopped playing Adele covers. She quickly discovered a talent for indelible pop melodies, switching confidently between fragile ballads and feisty pop bangers. Nineteen-year-old Alex O'Connor is a former chorister and Brit School graduate, whose bedroom productions were inspired by a love of classic songwriters like Stevie Wonder. His heartfelt vocals have been sought out by the likes of Tyler, The Creator and Skepta, who invited him on stage at last year's Mercury Prize. Manchester's Diana DeBrito, aka IAMDDB, fuses reflective, soulful vocals with trap beats and jazz melodies. She dropped her first track just over a year ago, on the same day she quit university after just an hour. Aged just 19, Khalid is already a star in the US, where his debut album American Teen has sold more than a million copies. His emotional, relatable songs are a diary of his high school years, full of love, loss, loneliness and longing. Manchester goth-pop band Pale Waves were formed at university by best friends and musical soulmates Heather Baron-Gracie (vocals, guitars) and Ciara Doran (drums). Championed by The 1975, who took them on tour last year, they describe their sound as \"90s-inspired indie-pop feels, drenched in reverb and glitter\". This year's winner was born Sigrid Solbakk Raabe in Alesund, a harbour town fringed by the mountains of western Norway. The singer said she was amazed to be recognised by an international audience. \"I've always thought that, since I'm from a small country, it would be more difficult to get my music across. But I guess streaming opened a lot of boundaries.\" She's also tweeted her reaction to winning, saying she was \"speechless\".  Sound of 2017 winner Ray BLK passed on her advice to this year's winner. \"Winning is just so overwhelming,\" she said. \"Everyone's like, 'You're supposed to be the next Adele, the next Sam Smith', and it makes you think, 'Oh no! What do I do?'\" \"But my advice would be: Just keep doing what you're doing. Build it your way.\" The Sound of... list launched in 2003 and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, including 50 Cent, Haim, Frank Ocean, Ellie Goulding and Florence + The Machine. According to the rules, acts on the longlist should not already be well known - so talent show contestants and members of famous bands launching solo careers are excluded. Nominees could not have had a UK top 10 single or album - although guest vocalists remained eligible. This year's longlist was dominated by pop acts, with Sigrid joined by fellow Scandipop artist Alma and dark pop practitioner Billie Eilish. Other nominees included experimental eight-piece Superorganism, whose members hail from the UK, Japan, Australia and New Zealand; and Hackney-born rapper Not3s, who had a viral hit last year with his single Addison Lee (Peng Ting Called Madison).
