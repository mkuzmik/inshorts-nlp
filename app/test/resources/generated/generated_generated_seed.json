The international trade secretary told the Sunday Times it would only be \"100% certain\" if MPs back the deal.  He said if the deal is rejected, that \"would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and Parliament\". MPs are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement in January, with the UK scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March.  The agreement negotiated by Mrs May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force with a majority backing in Parliament. The Commons vote was due to be held on 11 December but the PM postponed it once it became clear it would be defeated by a large margin. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn this week urged Mrs May to cut short MPs' Christmas break - they are due back in the Commons on 7 January - to allow for an earlier vote. Mr Fox has warned fellow MPs that failure to pass the deal would be \"incendiary\" and said it was \"a matter of honour\" for them to support the PM. He said: \"What you can be sure of is that if we vote for the prime minister's deal then it's 100% certain that we will leave on 29 March. \"If we do not vote for that, I'm not sure I would give it much more than 50-50. \"And, for me, that would induce a sense that we had betrayed the people that had voted in the referendum.\" Please upgrade your browser Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the campaign for another referendum, said: \"The only thing that is shattering the bond of trust between electorate and Parliament is the refusal of ministers like Liam Fox to trust people with the final say on Brexit.\" If Mrs May's deal is rejected, the default position is for the UK to leave in March unless the government seeks to extend the Article 50 negotiating process or Parliament intervenes to stop it happening. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has urged the UK to \"get your act together and then tell us what it is you want\" for Brexit. Speaking to the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, he said it was \"unreasonable\" for parts of the British public to expect Brussels to solve \"British problems\". Mr Juncker also rejected the idea that the EU wanted to keep the UK in the EU \"by all possible means\" and suggested the majority of MPs \"deeply distrust\" the EU and Theresa May.

Southampton responded to David Silva's early opener when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg took the ball off Oleksandr Zinchenko and fired it into the top corner. City had luck on their side when Raheem Sterling's shot deflected off James Ward-Prowse to make it 2-1. Sergio Aguero's back-post header completed the scoring before half-time. Southampton goalscorer Hojbjerg - who had only just returned from suspension - was shown a straight red card for a lunging tackle on Fernandinho with just over five minutes to go. City had a number of decent chances as Silva, Aguero and Riyad Mahrez all went close in the first half and Aguero smacked the crossbar after the break. Southampton threatened too and Charlie Austin was twice denied by City keeper Ederson in the first half before Hojbjerg's equaliser. But the Saints were ultimately undone by Pep Guardiola's free-flowing side, who move up to second place in the table. Liverpool went 10 points clear of City at the top of the table with a devastating 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal on Saturday, meaning the defending champions needed victory to keep pace in the title race. City appeared to feel the pressure on Boxing Day when they squandered an early lead and allowed Leicester to win 2-1 at the King Power Stadium.  But they stood up to the challenge at St Mary's - peppering Southampton's goal from the off and responding to the equaliser with two quick goals on the stroke of half-time. City's opening goal was straight from Guardiola's textbook: Bernardo Silva's neat build-up down the right and cut-back into the centre was comfortably put away by an unmarked David Silva. Sterling's shot was then deflected by Ward-Prowse and flapped into the net by Alex McCarthy to make it 2-1 before Aguero headed in Zinchenko's cross at the back post with ease.  It means City can cut Liverpool's lead to four points when the two teams meet at the Etihad Stadium on 3 January. The last time Southampton played City in early November they were hammered 6-1 and failed to respond to three early goals. But this time Southampton posed a threat and came close to breaking down a slightly nervy City defence on occasions. Austin's header at the near post was well saved by Ederson in the first half and that came moments after the keeper had avoided Hojbjerg's sliding tackle on the goal-line.  And Saints' pressing paid off when Hojbjerg robbed Zinchenko of the ball in the build-up to his equaliser. City could not extend their lead in the second half but Southampton's good work was only undone by the late sending-off of Hojbjerg. A trip to Stamford Bridge is a difficult start to the new year but the Saints will likely avoid the drop if they can produce performances like this in the second half of the season.  Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"The first 15-20 minutes we were not very good but we smelt a bit of sensation when we equalised. We saw that Man City is not that confident in the moment like they are when they win week after week. We tried to push ourselves back into the game and press a little bit earlier but we saw when they have time to turn they are dangerous. \"At half time we thought about preparing the guys for a good second half but in the mind was also the next game against Chelsea. And then the worst thing happened in the red card for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg which is disappointing because he is one of the most important players in our team.  \"In a game which is 3-1 and with only five minutes to go, you have to ask the use of such a tackle. He knows it was the wrong decision but it doesn't help us in the moment.\" \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It was important to win after two defeats and the players did what they had to do. If one team achieves 100 points and then the year after make 45 in the first round it is not all bad. \"Before 1-1 we played to score more, then they scored and the game was more equal but we carried on and scored the second goal.

Kante scored the only goal of the game in the 51st minute when he broke forward from midfield to convert David Luiz's throughball. There were few clear-cut chances as the Blues dominated possession and Palace sat back hoping to catch the opposition on the counter-attack - a tactic which failed to work as Roy Hodgson's Eagles took 85 minutes to register their first effort. That is now two successive games without a goal. Chelsea's Willian came close to scoring with a free-kick that struck the post, and Ross Barkley also hit the woodwork with a hooked effort. Fourth-placed Blues now have 43 points, one behind City and two behind Spurs. Palace remain in 14th with 19 points. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The Kante of 2018-19 is made up of different spec to previous models. Gone is the role of anchor man in midfield - the ball-winner who would allow other midfielders to make forays into the opposition's final third. The remodelled version has been given permission to burst forward from the right of a midfield trio. During a largely nondescript opening 45 minutes, he made two runs into the Palace box - the first resulting in a strike that missed Vicente Guaita's far post by two feet. Sarri's perseverance with the tactic paid off six minutes after the break when Kante grabbed his third goal of the season after again breaking from midfield. This time it was defender Luiz the provider, with a threaded pass that found the Frenchman whose shot had enough power to beat the hand of the former Valencia keeper. Willian also went close for the Blues with a free-kick that came off the Palace post, while fellow midfielder Barkley hooked a shot from close range that grazed the woodwork. It was a competent if unremarkable display from Sarri's side, but they did not have to break sweat against a lifeless Palace attack. This was an utterly forgettable display by Palace.  They defended admirably but appeared to show little desire to put pressure on the opposition backline. Their first effort on goal came in the 85th minute when Wilfried Zaha fired wide and high, before substitute Connor Wickham's strike from six yards resulted in a similar outcome. Hodgson grimaced from the sidelines, as must have the Palace supporters inside Selhurst Park. The former England manager explained that his side stuck to their defensive tactics after Chelsea scored because of the risk of \"conceding another three or four\". \"I thought we worked as hard as we could have,\" he said. \"We kept them in front of us and they had the ball, but they were creating goal chances. \"When they scored we had two options; either fly at it and risk conceding another three or four, or keep it tight and try and win an undeserved point in the last 15 minutes.\" Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a difficult match. I am happy with the team because we dominated for 85 minutes, although we didn't kill the match, so we had to fight again for the last five minutes.\" On Kante's goal: \"He is improving with the right timing and good movement and now I think that we have to work on Ross Barkley. We now need continuity because in the last five matches we played very well in three, and badly in two, so now is the moment to have continuity. \"We have to play 19 matches, so other team's results are not important but it is crucial to have continuity. In two days we have had four injuries, with Cesc Fabregas, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Danny Drinkwater, and then today Olivier Giroud.

The hosts began the final day on 258-8 chasing an unlikely 399, but after rain delayed the start, India needed only 4.3 overs to wrap up the win. Jasprit Bumrah, who took career-best match figures of 9-86, had Pat Cummins edge to slip for 63, before Nathan Lyon gloved Ishant Sharma behind. The fourth and final Test starts in Sydney on 2 January. Bumrah's haul was the best by an India pace bowler in Australia and the 25-year-old leads the series standings with 20 wickets, three more than Australia spinner Lyon. \"Credit has to go to the bowlers. I think they have been outstanding, especially Jasprit. The way he bowled in this Test match was outstanding,\" said India captain Virat Kohli, whose side will retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. \"The mindset he has at the moment is what separates him from anyone else in the world right now. He looks at a pitch and he doesn't think it's a hard toil, he thinks wickets, he thinks 'how can I get a breakthrough for the team'. \"What I've seen in the last 12 months is the way he has matured in Test cricket and the way that he is bowling so soon, so quickly in his Test career, I think is a very scary sign for all the batsmen around the world. \"I mean, in Test cricket if there is a pitch like Perth, I wouldn't want to face Jasprit Bumrah, to be honest, because once he's on a roll he can really crank it up.\" India bounced back after losing the second Test in Perth to declare twice at the MCG, with their bowlers tearing Tim Paine's side apart for 151 and 261. The defeat in Melbourne came in Paine's sixth Test match as Australia captain after replacing Steve Smith, who was banned along with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft for ball-tampering during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March. Smith and Warner's year-long suspensions will expire in late March 2019, and Paine admitted Australia missed their presence following a poor batting performance. \"I think it's inexperience, it's pressure, India's bowling attack is probably as good as most of us have ever played,\" he said. \"I think it's pretty clear that if you take two or three of the best players out of anyone's line-up around the world, you're going to struggle a little bit at times and you are going to have inconsistent performances. \"The silver lining is that we do have world-class players that are available soon to come back into this side, and clearly when they do they will make a huge difference.\" With several players under pressure for their place, the Aussies have added all-rounder Marnus Labuschagne to their squad for the final Test.

It said it would be willing to work with the US to \"implement the important consensus\" reached at December's G20. At the Buenos Aires summit the two countries agreed to suspend new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. China's statement comes after President Donald Trump tweeted \"big progress\" was being made in relations after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made! End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump In Saturday's tweet, the US president said \"talks were moving along very well\". Sunday's statement from Lu Kang, the spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry, appeared to confirm President Trump's optimism. \"China stands ready to work with the US to implement the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and President Trump in Argentina, expand co-operation on the basis of mutual benefit, manage differences on the basis of mutual respect,\" Mr Lu said. Prior to the G20 meeting in Argentina, the US had warned it was considering 25% tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3152bn) of Chinese goods - more than double the 10% initially planned. The White House says the tariffs are a response to China's unfair trade policies, which Mr Trump blames for helping to create a huge trade deficit. Mr Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to make trade fairer for the US, and repeatedly blamed China's trading practices for making American manufacturers less competitive. The US imposed tariffs on a number of Chinese products, including consumer and industrial items such as handbags and rice. China responded in kind, and both sides - the world's two largest economies - ended up imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of goods. The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Tariffs ended up raising costs for American companies. Analysts say this is one of a number of factors that have put pressure on markets in recent weeks. In early December, Mr Xi and Mr Trump met after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires for the first time since their trade war started. Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January, and the US said China would buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products. The details of that deal are yet to be ironed out, however.

The move  further strengthens the board as pledged by founder Elon Musk to the Securities and Exchanges Commission. The SEC fined Mr Musk over misleading tweets that he had funding to take Tesla private. Investors greeted the news by sending Tesla shares up more than 4% in morning Friday trading.  Elon Musk remains as chief executive although he agreed with the SEC in October he would step down as chairman.  Larry Ellison is the co-founder and chairman of enterprise cloud software firm Oracle - currently the third largest software maker in the world after Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet.  He already owns three million shares of Tesla stock and is a close friend of Mr Musk.  Actor Robert Downey Jr modelled the character of Tony Stark on Mr Musk for the film Iron Man in 2008, and in 2010, Mr Musk and Mr Ellison famously made cameo appearances in Iron Man 2 as fellow tech billionaires.  Kathleen Wilson-Thompson is the global head of human resources at international pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, and was previously an executive at Kellogg.  The new appointments follow November's move by Tesla to appoint Australian telecoms executive Robyn Denholm as its new chairman. In August, Mr Musk posted a tweet saying that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker off the stock market and make it a private company. He claimed that the funding proposal would value Tesla at $420 per share. Shares in the company briefly rose after his announcement, but later fell again. The SEC said the claim was \"false and misleading\", and decided to sue him for alleged securities fraud. Although he agreed to step down as chairman and pay a $20m (\u00a315m) settlement fine, Mr Musk said recently that he does not respect the SEC. The SEC settlement follows a turbulent year for Tesla and Mr Musk.  In February, Tesla reported a record quarterly loss, partly caused by the carmaker's revamp of its manufacturing process to boost output of the Model 3. The revamp was needed after a surge of orders in 2017 saw it struggling to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers. This prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings. In June, Tesla cut 9% of its workforce as part of a restructuring intended to reduce costs and boost profitability. In October the carmaker reported a quarterly profit for just the third time in its 15-year history. In a striking and emotional interview to the New York Times in August, Mr Musk said he had not been on drugs when he posted the tweets about taking Tesla private. He did however say that he was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks, and that the past year had been the \"most difficult and painful\" of his career.

The Chinese company's chairman has also complained of his firm's \"incredibly unfair treatment\" abroad. In recent weeks, the UK's Defence Secretary and chief of MI6 have been among those to warn that use of Huawei's 5G kit poses risks that need fuller consideration. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and Japan have also flagged concerns. Experts have warned that the Chinese government could compel the company to disrupt telecom networks that use its equipment or spy on their customers. But Huawei denies it would ever do so, noting that such action would undermine its business.  Last week, it invited the media to visit its 5G and cyber-security research labs in Dongguan, Guangdong as part of efforts to counter criticism.  Many of Huawei's clients opt for its products over rivals, such as Nokia and Ericsson, on both cost and technical grounds.  In addition, its smartphones have proven popular with the public.  Huawei recently revealed it had shipped more than 200 million handsets in 2018, placing it second only to Samsung in terms of market share.  \"We are ahead of others in domains like wireless, optical, data communications, and smart devices,\" wrote chairman Guo Ping in a New Year's message shared online. \"For 5G markets that choose to not work with Huawei - they will be like an NBA [National Basketball Association] game without star players: the game will go on, but with less deftness, flair, and expertise.\" Beijing's criticism of the UK was published in the Global Times, an English-language government newspaper.

It said Wu's comment was made in reaction to UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson saying earlier this week that: \"We've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.\" Having made play on a Jane Austen novel title, the newspaper also referenced another popular phrase to offer advice to Huawei, telling it to \"calm down and carry on\" in a separate editorial.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46691846", "content": "A majority stake in Gatwick Airport is to be sold to French operator Vinci Airports for \u00a32.9bn.  Vinci Airports, part of infrastructure group Vinci, will buy 50.01% of the UK's second-busiest airport.  The other 49.99% will be managed by current owners Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). The airport was closed in the run-up to Christmas after reports of drone sightings, in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind. Flights were grounded and about 140,000 passengers affected over three days during the incident. In 2016, Gatwick's expansion plans were dealt a blow when the government rejected its proposal for a new second runway while giving the go-ahead for Heathrow to build a third runway. Gatwick was acquired by a GIP-led consortium in 2009. More than 45 million passengers travel through Gatwick each year, flying to 230 destinations in 70 countries, according to its website. The deal would make Gatwick the largest airport in Vinci's network, which will grow to 46 airports in 12 countries - with a total traffic of about 228 million passengers a year, according to the company. It follows Vinci's takeover of Airports Worldwide's portfolio earlier this year, which included Belfast International and stakes in 12 airports across the US.  Commenting on recent disruption at Gatwick, Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports, said he had \"every confidence\" in the teams currently in place.  \"We will of course work with the airport operational team and the existing shareholders to make Gatwick as resilient as it can be in the face of these new risks,\" he added. Before Christmas, Gatwick was in the public eye for all the wrong reasons. It  was brought to a standstill and around 1,000 flights were cancelled due to apparent drone activity. But the fact remains, London's second airport is potentially a lucrative asset. It handles more than 45 million passengers every year and makes hundreds of millions of pounds in profit.  Vinci says it also offers \"significant potential for growth\". The question is, where will that growth come from? Gatwick is already operating at a high level of efficiency, squeezing the maximum number of landings and takeoffs from its single runway. Its proposal to build a second runway was rejected by the government in 2016. But it has a back-up idea. Earlier this year, it set out a \"masterplan\" for the future - which suggested that an emergency standby runway could be expanded and brought into daily use, to increase capacity. That would certainly be a controversial move - but if it succeeded, there could be major benefits for Vinci. So perhaps the French firm thinks it's worth a gamble. US-based GIP said it expected the transaction to be completed \"by the middle of next year\".

This week we speak to Andy Mooney, chief executive of US guitar company Fender, and formerly a senior executive at both Nike and Disney. Andy Mooney was standing in line at an ice rink in Phoenix, Arizona, when he had a eureka moment that continues to earn entertainment giant Disney more than $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) a year. This was back in 2000, soon after Mr Mooney, a Scot, had been appointed head of Disney's consumer products division. Joining the company after 20 years at Nike, he was working hard to bring himself fully up to speed on every facet of the business. This included going to see a production of Disney on Ice, where figure skaters portray Disney characters. While queuing to get in he noticed that a great many of the young girls - and also their mothers - had dressed up in generic princess dresses, to look like Disney heroines, such as Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. Disney didn't sell such dresses at the time, but Mr Mooney immediately realised that the company was missing an incredibly lucrative trick. \"I was standing in line with mothers and daughters, all dressed head to toe in princess regalia that they had made at home,\" says Mr Mooney, 63. \"I said to a few of the mums 'if Disney made official dresses like this would you buy them?', and they all replied that they'd buy lots. \"So I rushed back to [Disney headquarters] in Burbank [Los Angeles], and we launched the Disney Princess series pretty quickly.\" Not only did Mr Mooney and his team introduce dresses based on those worn by Disney's best-known female characters, they set to work on everything from books to lunchboxes, dolls, magazines, computer games, pyjamas, and tie-ups with food producers. The idea was to start selling basically everything that female Disney fans, both young and old, might like to buy, all featuring one or more Disney princess. \"By the end of 2001 sales across the Disney Princess lines were something like $300m, and today it is more than $6bn a year,\" he says. This is not the success in life that Mr Mooney could have dreamed of when he grew up in a council house in the small Scottish town of Whitburn, half way between Glasgow and Edinburgh. The son of a miner, he left school at 16 to train as an accountant at his local tyre factory. Yet from this modest start, he went on to play a key role in the growth of US footwear and sportswear company Nike. And after his success at Disney, he is now chief executive at Fender, which - for someone who has been an avid guitar player since he was a teenager - is his \"dream job\". After a number of years at the tyre plant Mr Mooney switched to a similarly unglamorous junior accountancy role at the local ironworks. Then aged 25, in 1980, he took his first steps towards to the top of the US corporate world when he applied for, and got, the job as chief finance officer of Nike's UK operation. \"In the interview they didn't ask me anything to do with my accountancy background, it was all about whether I was a cultural fit,\" says Mr Mooney. At the time Nike was primarily selling running shoes, so to best understand the business and his products Mr Mooney says he switched from playing football to jogging. \"I picked up running when I joined, and I have stuck at it ever since, running marathons around the world,\" he says. While Mr Mooney's day job was a financial one, he started to impress his bosses with his gut instinct for what shoes would sell particularly well, and how Nike could best sell more of them.  So much so that Nike UK switched him to head of marketing in 1982. Two years later he was poached by the marketing team at Nike's head office in Oregon, rising to the become chief marketing officer. While at Nike Mr Mooney was a key mover behind the introduction of special limited editions trainers, when inspiration came to him at a set of traffic lights. \"I had become relatively successful, so I could afford to buy a very bad used Porsche 924,\" he says. Then a guy pulled up alongside me in a bright yellow 924, and I went 'what the hell is that?'. I discovered that it was a limited edition version of the car, and I wondered if that would work in shoes... It was a big success.\" After 20 years at Nike Mr Mooney says that Disney approached him, and he left for a fresh challenge in 2000, taking up the head of consumer products role. He stayed with Disney for 11 years before leaving to spend just 26 months as chief executive at sportswear brand Quiksilver, where he admits that for once things didn't work out for him. When he joined Quiksilver it was struggling with debts of more than $1bn. The top position at Fender followed in 2015, which Mr Mooney says really is \"an honour\" for someone who already had a collection of more than 40 guitars. More The Boss features: While he says that Fender's annual turnover is a very respectable $500m, he wants to help increase this by reducing the number of people who give up on trying to learn to play their guitar. \"The industry has a retention problem,\" he says. \"Some 45% of guitars we sell go to first time buyers, half of whom are women, but 90% of all new players then abandon the instrument in the first year.\" To help more people learn how to play their guitar (and then potentially buy another), Fender launched \"Fender Play\" last year, online guitar tutorials that are now used by 70,000 people. Mark Ritson, adjunct professor of marketing at Melbourne Business School, says: \"Andy Mooney is an unusual chief executive. \"He has a strong marketing background, and has proven adept at first understanding the customers his businesses were targeting, and then using that knowledge to diversify and grow revenues. \"His role at Fender will be to do that again. The fact that he plays a mean guitar does him no harm either.\" When not busy at work Mr Mooney now jams with some of his guitar heroes, such as Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine, and Jim Root of Slipknot. And he has swapped Scotland for Los Angeles' exclusive Hollywood Hills. \"I do have to pinch myself,\" he says.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46699288", "content": "US financial markets were mixed on Friday after a choppy trading session that bounced between gains and losses. The Dow Jones index sank 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell about 0.1%, but the Nasdaq gained almost 0.1%. The moves marked a relatively calm end to a wild week of trade, in which US indexes rallied sharply after plunging on Monday. European markets built on those gains on Friday. The FTSE 100 share index closed up more than 2.2% at 6,733.97. In Germany, the DAX gained about 1.7%, while France's CAC index also rose about 1.7%. Many markets have had a dismal year, as investor sentiment soured on fears of decelerating global growth, trade tensions and rising interest rates. Japan's Nikkei suffered its first annual loss in seven years, while Germany's Dax index closed the year down about 18% - the biggest annual loss in a decade. On Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.31% lower at 20,014.77, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed flat, at 25,504.20. In the US, Friday's declines were fairly widespread. However, they spared the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers such as Amazon. Amazon shares jumped more than 1% on Friday, days after the  e-commerce giant told investors it had a \"record-breaking\" holiday season. Analysts cautioned that movements were exacerbated by the lower dealing levels seen during holiday trading. US shares have been hit this week by weaker than expected home sales and consumer confidence data. Concerns about US-China trade tensions also resurfaced, with reports saying US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order banning the use of Chinese technology.

So very sad. I once sent a letter to many actors as a budding (I mean desperate) comedy actor to ask for sponsorship for the Edinburgh Festival. Dame June replied. Fifteen years later when I met her she had all my letters and the notes of the show she sponsored.

Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus all had their troubles but managed to escape the year without seeing their brands trashed in quite the same way as their parent. So, it's no surprise to see articles related to Facebook's various scandals secured it three of the spots in BBC Tech's most-read stories list for 2018. Two other controversy magnets - Elon Musk and Huawei - however, narrowly missed out.  And for the first time since we started compiling this list in 2012, none of the placings went to a product launch. Below are the most clicked on articles for each month of the year - a mix of controversy, endeavour and sparkly revenge. January: Chipocalypse Now Software flaws have long been a bane of computing, but when news emerged of serious vulnerabilities in popular processor chips there was a serious intake of breath from the cyber-security community. Billions of PCs, smartphones and other devices were said to be susceptible to the Meltdown and Spectre bugs - including, as it emerged, Apple's products. At one point there was talk of owners having to brace themselves for their machines feeling noticeably more sluggish as a result of the workarounds that would be needed, or even needing to send their computers in for component swap-outs. A year on, there doesn't appear to have been any malware related to the flaws reported in the wild, even though further variants of the originally disclosed exploits have been discovered.  And as far as personal computers are concerned, the patches released don't appear to have caused much of a hit to performance. February: Fake porn Deepfakes gave the internet something else to worry about in February, after it emerged that free software meant anyone could replace the face of one person with another's in video footage so long as you had enough photos of the latter. Inevitably, the tool was used to create pornography with a range of predominantly young female celebrities' features generated to supplant those of the original adult actresses. One after another websites lined up to ban the content until Reddit, which had been home to much of it, decided to do likewise. As the algorithms involved have improved, there has been much discussion about the danger of fake news creators adopting the face-mapping technique  to create bogus videos of politicians. But there's another worrying trend.  It appears that some Deepfakers are attempting to scrape social media for images of acquaintances that they can turn into pornography, and have been sharing details of their progress in chat forums. March: Cambridge Analytica Donald Trump's election in 2016 helped put Cambridge Analytica in the public eye after reports that its psychological profiles of US voters had helped his campaign target messages. But the London-based consultancy only became a household name after a report in the Observer explained how the firm had made use of millions of harvested Facebook accounts' details, while a follow-up Channel 4 TV report recorded the consultancy's chief on tape discussing how beautiful girls could be sent to a politician's house  as a honey-trap. Facebook also found itself in the firing line. It didn't help itself by first trying to suppress the story and then quibbling over whether it warranted being described as a \"data breach\". Yesterday @facebook threatened to sue us. Today we publish this. Meet the whistleblower blowing the lid off Facebook & Cambridge Analytica. https://t.co/QcuBJfBU5T End of Twitter post  by @carolecadwalla When Mark Zuckerberg did finally apologise several days later, he made a promise that has been repeatedly thrown back at him since. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he said. April: Scandal grows By early April, Facebook was estimating that up to 87 million of its members' details had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. More than a million of them were thought to belong to UK-based users.  This was based on the number of accounts that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - had harvested from the social network via a personality quiz. Soon after, Cambridge Analytica responded that its parent, SCL Elections, had in fact \"only\" licensed 30 million people's records from Dr Kogan, and all, it said, had been from US citizens. That wasn't enough to save it - the political consultancy folded in May. But it now forms part of Facebook's defence against a fine from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which was imposed despite the watchdog acknowledging that it had found no evidence that UK citizens' data had been passed to Cambridge Analytica. The \u00a3500,000 amount is peanuts to the social network - it makes more in half an hour, and the reputational damage it has incurred has arguably been far more costly. But Facebook is concerned that the penalty could set a precedent for other data regulators to follow. May: RIP TotalBiscuit The British video games critic John \"TotalBiscuit\" Bain had first told his fans and wider following that he had cancer in 2015. By April 2018 the 33-year-old had announced he was retiring from journalism as the medication he was on was preventing him from thinking clearly. Even so, his death shocked and saddened many of his 2.2 million YouTube fans when it was confirmed. The obituaries that followed mostly focused on how he had championed indie games and criticised some of their bigger-budgeted rivals, which he had said sometimes prioritised profit over all else.  But on social media and in some later articles, there was criticism of the role Mr Bain had played in the GamerGate movement. It was claimed he had given legitimacy to a misogynistic campaign that had been responsible for the harassment of others.  But this in turn spurred on his supporters to defend his legacy. They said his involvement had been mischaracterised and noted that Mr Bain had called for ethics in games journalism for several years before GamerGate existed. June: Data from the deep The phrase \"the cloud\" conjures up images of our data being stored in some nebulous form high above us. In reality, tech firms are investing billions of pounds in racks of computer servers housed in gigantic data centres across the globe to power the apps we use and internet services we call on. For the most part, these are built at ground-level. But in June, Microsoft sank an experimental data centre into the sea off Orkney in the north of Scotland. The idea is to reduce cooling costs by keeping the equipment in a sealed vault underwater. The tech giant intends to monitor Project Natick for five years to see if the scheme is a practical proposition for a wider rollout. But elsewhere, Google revealed it had already made the switch to liquid-cooling to tackle the heat given off by its latest artificial intelligence-focused computer servers. But rather than dropping its equipment overboard, it is piping coolant to each chip. July: Thoughtless threat PayPal was guilty of a major faux pas when it wrote to Lindsay Durdle, one of its recently deceased customers, to say her death was a breach of its rules. To make matters worse, it added that it might take legal action as a consequence. Her husband Howard Durdle was appalled, and to be fair so was PayPal's PR team when the BBC brought the matter to its attention. Although the firm was unable to confirm exactly what had gone wrong it attempted to make good on the situation by writing off a debt his wife had owed. \"PayPal have been in touch, have apologised sincerely and have promised to change whatever they need to internally to ensure this can't happen again,\" Mr Durdle tweeted after the BBC's article was published. \"I just hope more organisations can apply empathy and common sense to avoid hurting the recently bereaved.\" August: Mystery satellite As official statements go, the US State Department's wasn't the most reassuring: \"We don't know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it.\" The subject was a Russian satellite that had been launched 10 months earlier and was displaying abnormal behaviour.  One US official suggested it could be a space weapon designed to destroy other satellites - an allegation a Russian diplomat slammed as being \"unfounded [and] slanderous\". For those who track such developments, the US's suspicions echoed those raised about another Russian launch four years earlier when what was thought to be a bit of debris started zipping about in orbit. In any case, at the end of the year we are officially none the wiser about the objects true capabilities.  But with the Trump administration pursuing its own plan to create a Space Force by 2020, off-planet militarisation looks set to remain a hot topic. September: Facebook flaw With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still ratting along, Facebook revealed that a separate problem had exposed almost 50 million accounts to being hijacked. The cause was a vulnerability in the code of its View As privacy facility, which was designed to let users see what their profile looked like to others. At the time, Facebook said it was \"temporarily turning off\" the tool while it conducted a review. Three months on, it remains disabled. The firm did, however, revise its estimate down to 30 million accounts. While we're on the topic, here's some of Facebook's other controversies in 2018: In an end of year message posted yesterday, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had become much more \"proactive\" at addressing the challenges it faced but warned some problems could \"never be fully solved\". But overall, he said he was \"proud of the progress\" Facebook had made in 2018. October: Power struggle Many of us have experienced the sinking feeling that comes from leaving the home in the morning to discover your smartphone battery never recharged overnight. Typically, it's a case of failing to properly plug the handset in. But a YouTuber's tests of the latest iPhones indicated some of the new devices only topped up their power if their displays were \"woken up\" first.  Inevitably this was dubbed \"chargegate\",  and when the BBC published its take on the issue Apple had yet to comment. But a week later, when it released the next version of its mobile operating system, Apple's accompanying notes confirmed it had fixed a bug that had caused the flaw. November: #Dontbeevil At the start of the year the Time's Up movement was founded to take a stand against sexual assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace. It was a response to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein but also marked an effort to tackle problems faced by women more widely. Eleven months later, seven of Google's employees declared \"time's up\" on the tech giant after accusations of misconduct emerged involving two past male high-fliers as well as dozens of other staff. As a result, workers at Google's offices across the world staged a series of walkouts. Managers were delivered a set of demands, including a call to end the firm's requirement that sexual harassment disputes be dealt with internally. About a week later, Google's chief Sundar Pichai confirmed that the business would indeed stop its policy of forced arbitration, opening the door to it being sued over the matter in the future. December: Glitter bomb The internet fell in love with a revenge prank staged by an ex-Nasa engineer earlier this month. After having a package stolen from his porch, Mark Rober constructed a \"bomb\" that married a centrifugal motor, lots of glitter, fart spray and several smartphones. He then hid the device within an Apple Homepod speaker box and left it on his porch. When thieves subsequently stole it, it recorded the moment it sprayed them with its contents. After which, Mr Rober retrieved the package and repeated the exercise. In an ideal world, the story would have ended there, with Mr Rober's YouTube fame assured thanks to the compilation video he made. But a couple of days after uploading the footage,  the inventor replaced the video with a shorter edit. Some viewers had voiced suspicions about parts of the footage, and Mr Rober acknowledged that when he had chased up their concerns he had discovered that one of his helpers had recruited acquaintances to pose as two of the five featured thieves. An important note: pic.twitter.com/9MgQFVbhoB End of Twitter post  by @MarkRober \"I'm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn't just taint the entire effort as 'fake',\" he tweeted. Most viewers seem to have been forgiving, but it's unfortunate that what was a fun stunt might cause many to be more suspicious and cynical about what they see online in the future.

District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, said the Washington Post.  It accused Facebook of allowing the wholesale scraping of personal data on tens of millions of users.  The action adds to a number of regulatory investigations, following a year of privacy and security missteps.  A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: \"We're reviewing the complaint and look forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in DC and elsewhere.\"  As well as this lawsuit, Facebook is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.  In the UK, the company was fined \u00a3500,000 over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the maximum fine the British data regulator could impose. Bigger trouble may arise from the Irish data protection regulator, which is investigating Facebook for multiple admissions of security flaws, in what is being seen as the first major test of Europe\u2019s new privacy rules as dictated by the General Data Protection Regulation.  According to the Post, the DC attorney general\u2019s action could be amended to include more recent data security admissions, including more revelations published on Wednesday by the New York Times.

But this popularity is fairly recent. Why have podcasts taken so long to become visible, and does that mean you can make a living out of them? It's easy to make a podcast.   All you need is something you want to say, a microphone, a recording device (known as a tape recorder in the old days) and some editing software.   For enthusiasts, part of the beauty of audio has always been that you don't have to be a technological wizard to create something magical. While podcasts have been around for a good decade and a half, they've emerged from their niche recently thanks to the proliferation of smartphones, podcast apps and voice-activated speakers in homes. Plus, their more informal, less \"produced\" style is proving popular with the much sought-after \"millennial\" generation, says Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism in New York. \"What podcasting has is a youth audience that feels very passionately about the people that they listen to and that they engage with.\" And the old problem of visibility has largely been solved by distribution platforms from the likes of Apple, SoundCloud and Whooshkaa, although it's still true that old fashioned word-of-mouth is one of the most effective ways of getting your podcast noticed. Now there are more than 600,000 shows worldwide covering everything from sport, politics and music, to the thoughts of geeks in their bedrooms. The podcast has become fashionable. And not just in the West. South Korea tops the global rankings, according to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2018, with 58% of its population listening to a news podcast in the past month, compared with 33% in the US and 18% in the UK. Young people are now far more likely to listen to podcasts than to speech radio, Reuters says. \"What distinguishes radio from TV is the intimacy. What distinguishes a podcast from radio is that it's intimacy plus, because you've chosen it and it's literally in your ears,\" explains Olly Mann, who's been co-hosting Answer me This since 2007 with comedian Helen Zaltzman, and now also produces The Modern Mann. \"People tend to listen on headphones in their personal bubble.\" He describes the growth in podcasts as a \"slow, gentle upward curve\", but like others, acknowledges that there is one show responsible for propelling the genre into the mainstream: Serial.  In October 2014, the team behind the successful public radio programme This American Life released the first episodes of their true crime story set in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Serial broke the mould because it was a podcast first, not just a radio show uploaded to the internet after broadcast, as was typical at the time. Producer Julie Snyder says this meant that if the show flopped, they hadn't wasted too much time, money or reputation. But listeners were gripped by reporter Sarah Koenig's investigation into the murder of high school student Hae Min Lee and the conviction and imprisonment of her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed.  Now in its third season, Serial has been downloaded 420 million times in total. And it's testament to the influence of Season One that Syed has been granted a retrial.  Source: Wired, Global, Vulture Lists \"A lot of people were not used to hearing non-fiction serialised storytelling that's as compelling as Serial was,\" says Ms Snyder. \"And because the technological barriers had sort of come down, it was really easy to get at. For the first time a lot of people learned how to access a podcast.\"  Its success encouraged many listeners to explore what else was out there, she believes. But how do you make money from podcasting? Here's where it gets a little complicated. Once you've pressed Save on your programme, you need a hosting platform to which you can drag and drop your show.  That platform creates an RSS (\"rich site summary\" or \"really simple syndication\") feed - the link between your audio file and the so-called pod catchers - programs that download and distribute the podcasts to your listening device. \"It's a very fragmented marketplace,\" says Ross Adams, chief executive of Acast, the Stockholm-based podcasting platform that hosts 3,500 podcasters.   Acast not only looks after the technical nuts and bolts, but also the advertising that gives podcasters a chance to monetise their content.  In common with other digital platforms, Acast's global sales teams sells advertising on a \"cost per mille\" (CPM) basis.  So if your podcast has 1,000 listeners and there are six ad slots, that adds up to a total of 6,000 impressions, or clicks, to sell. But podcast advertising doesn't come cheap. Airtime ads start at about \u00a312 ($15) CPM, but some branded content may sell for as much as \u00a3100 ($126) CPM, says Mr Adams. More Technology of Business \"It's the most expensive priced audio product in the marketplace,\" says Mr Adams, largely because podcast audiences tend to be affluent and audio ads are effective, particularly if they're read out by the programme host.  \"It's not a commercial radio audience that's listening, it's the Netflix subscriber, the Spotify premium subscriber,\" he says. \"It's the very affluent audiences, which is why we can charge a lot higher.\" This sounds like good news for the impoverished podcaster, but bear in mind that as far as spending on digital advertising goes, audio is still the poor relation to video, where revenue is measured in billions, rather than hundreds of millions.  Nevertheless, a report for the Interactive Advertising Bureau by consultants PWC predicts advertising revenues in the US digital audio sector will grow more than 110% to $659m (\u00a3521m) by 2020. It's that sort of upward trend that has convinced industry heavyweights like the UK radio company Global to launch a podcasting service on its global player app. Networks like Radiotopia and Gimlet Media, and platforms and apps like Acast and Global, help make the podcast visible to listeners and advertisers, and because they aggregate podcasters, even those with lower download figures stand a chance of attracting advertising. That said, the marketplace is still too crowded for many people to make serious money.   \"For anybody who wants to make a living on it there's nowhere near enough money,\" says Emily Bell. \"I'm sure probably over 80% of the revenue goes to the top 20% of the podcasts.\"  But audio has never been all about the money. It's a medium for enthusiasts produced by enthusiasts. And podcasts may have secured its future.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46717535", "content": "\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Pep Guardiola says Manchester City have to \"accept\" that title rivals Liverpool could be the \"best team in the world right now\". Defending champions City, who beat Southampton 3-1 on Sunday, go into Thursday's home game against Liverpool seven points adrift of the Reds. \"The problem is the other team is fantastic,\" said Guardiola. \"[Liverpool are] maybe the best team in Europe or the world right now and in top form.\" While City have suffered defeats against Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Leicester in December, Liverpool have won every single game they have played. They ended 2018 in style, beating Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield to briefly go 10 points clear of City. Speaking about Liverpool's ability, Guardiola added: \"You have to accept it. All we can do is do our job, play our games and after that we will see.\" In addition to their dominant position in the league, Liverpool have a recent edge over City because they knocked the Blues out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals last season. If the Reds were to win on Thursday, they would restore their 10-point cushion and become heavy favourites to win a first league title since 1990. City captain Vincent Kompany said the game against the league leaders is the type of match \"you live for\". \"Our pride has been hurt over recent weeks but we have everything to play for.

The 26-year-old Australia batsman, whose ban ended on Saturday, lasted only three deliveries in the Scorchers' 107-8 in Launceston. Bancroft was caught using sandpaper to alter the condition of the ball against South Africa in Cape Town in March. The Hurricanes chased 108 to win by six wickets with 15 balls to spare. A fourth successive victory extended their lead at the top of the table to four points. Bancroft, who came in at number five with the Scorchers 16-3, collected two to square leg off the first ball he faced. He defended his next delivery before edging Riley Meredith behind as he attempted to force off the back foot. Meredith finished with 3-15, while Jofra Archer, who will qualify for England in 2019, returned figures of 0-26 and England's David Willey made six off 13 balls.

The year began with an Ashes drubbing for England, featured a fairytale summer farewell and ended with Virat Kohli arguing with someone. Again. Oh, and some Australians got banned for cheating along the way. BBC Sport hands out the prizes after a tumultuous year in the cricket world. Surely you don't need to ask? Already India captain, totem and icon, Virat Kohli proved this year he is unquestionably the best player in the world. If his returns in Test cricket were impressive - 1,322 at an average of 55 - his one-day international haul of 1,202 at 134 bordered on ludicrous. He arrived in England this summer with question marks over his claims to greatness. He responded by averaging 59 in a series when most batsmen survived as long as an ice cube on a warm day. Despite defeat in England, Kohli led India to a first Test win in Australia in 10 years - and they will begin 2019 as they did 2018, as officially the best side in the world. If New Zealand had played more than six Tests, Kane Williamson - with an average of 67 - might have run Kohli close, while Alyssa Healy won a staggering four player-of-the-match awards in six games as Australia women romped to the Women's World Twenty20 title. Alastair Cook and James Anderson can accept this award on behalf of their scriptwriter, who delivered an end to the summer so joyful that it made the Shawshank Redemption finale look positively miserable. From the moment Cook, the holder of almost every England Test batting record there is, announced the final Test against India would be his last, you sensed it might be emotional. Walking out to bat, taking guard, maybe even adjusting his box - Cook was given countless standing ovations before he sent the Oval crowd into a frenzy with a fairytale farewell century in his final innings. Anderson supplied the encore the following day with his 564th Test wicket, taking him past Australia great Glenn McGrath as the most successful pace bowler of all time and wrapping up a 4-1 series win. Cook called Anderson the greatest player of all time. Anderson said the same about Cook. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. Cameron Bancroft, take a bow. The Australia batsman wins this from a field of one, although he might ask Steve Smith and David Warner to accompany him to the awards ceremony. Bancroft was caught during the Cape Town Test against South Africa trying to scuff up the ball using sandpaper - which he then tried to hide down his trousers. All in full view of the television cameras. Bancroft was banned for nine months, while captain Smith and vice-captain Warner - both of whom admitted knowing about the plan - got a year apiece. Sympathy was in short supply. The Australian and British prime ministers put the boot in, and Smith and Warner blubbed like three-year-olds in news conferences broadcast around the world. Coach Darren Lehmann said he didn't know about the sandpaper plan and wouldn't resign. Then he did. Needless to say, there were tears there too. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Australia fans, look away again. A couple of hefty defeats on that ill-fated tour of South Africa were contenders for this prize - Australia lost the third Test by 322 runs and the fourth by 492 - and they were crushed by 373 runs by Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. But the biggest thumping of the year was dished out by England, who won the third one-day international against Australia by 242 runs. The hosts smashed the ODI record in making a scarcely believable 481-6 at Trent Bridge. Alex Hales battered 147 off 92 balls, Jonny Bairstow 139 off 92. Australia were bowled out for 237, with 13 overs unused. There must have been a temptation for England to let them have another go. It was Australia's heaviest one-day defeat in terms of runs. They lost the series 5-0. The flight home could not come soon enough. Bangladesh gave it their best shot when they were bowled out for 43 by West Indies, while South Africa laid claim to the award in being skittled for 73 in 29 overs in Sri Lanka.  Pakistan losing their last seven wickets for 41 runs as they contrived to lose the first Test by four runs against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi was mightily impressive in its own way. However, at a time when England seem intent on bringing the collapse back into fashion, it simply had to be Joe Root's side who collected this gong. Playing their first Test since being thumped 4-0 in the Ashes, England folded like a cheap deckchair against New Zealand as they were bowled out for 58 in the face of some admittedly excellent swing bowling from Trent Boult and Tim Southee. It was their sixth lowest total in Test history. The innings barely lasted 20 overs. Five batsmen made ducks. Only two reached double figures. One saving grace for England was that, from 27-9, it could have been even worse. A tough one, mainly because there has been plenty of anger on and off the cricket pitch this year. It began with CCTV footage of Australia's David Warner and South Africa's Quinton de Kock being separated by team-mates in the stairwell outside the changing rooms in Durban. It continued with a pumped-up Kagiso Rabada shoulder-barging Steve Smith in the very next Test in Port Elizabeth. Confrontation is like oxygen to the scowling India skipper Virat Kohli, although his 'mic drop' impersonation in an attempt to rile Joe Root at Edgbaston proved fruitless. The award, though, goes to England's Jonny Bairstow, who 'celebrated' his century against Sri Lanka on his return to the side by ripping off his helmet, dropping his bat and letting out a roar that would not have been out of place in WWE. That he was miffed at what he perceived as criticism from the media made it all the more remarkable. Anyone who can have an argument in an empty room deserves to win this prize. Amelia Kerr smashed a women's record 232 not out off 145 balls for New Zealand in an ODI in Ireland. Then she took 5-17. Best of all, she was only 17 at the time. Australia seamer Andrew Tye, who conceded an eye-watering 0-100 from nine overs in England's ODI-record 481 at Trent Bridge.  Glenn Maxwell's remarkable effort to remove Faf du Plessis, leaping to catch the ball at long-on, throwing it up in mid-air while over the boundary, jumping back inside the rope and completing the catch on the run. In an age when exceptional catches have almost become the norm, this was still something else. Remember Mason Crane? The leg-spinner took 1-193 in the final Ashes Test in Sydney, the most expensive figures by an England debutant. A back injury forced him home from the New Zealand tour that followed, then ended his county season in June. Joe Denly. Aged 32 and out of the England side for more than eight years, the Kent all-rounder was recalled for the winter tour to Sri Lanka. In his first game back, he only went and won the man-of-the-match award, with 20 off 17 balls and 4-19 opening the bowling with his leg-spin. David Warner, one of cricket's most notorious sledgers, walked off the field mid-innings during a Sydney grade match after receiving a few choice words from Jason Hughes, the brother of the late Phillip Hughes. While what was said remains a mystery, the irony was not lost on anyone. With all due respect to the record-breaking Alastair Cook and the cuddly old-timer Rangana Herath, AB de Villiers is a clear winner of this award. An entertainer, innovator and all-round good egg, he scored more than 20,000 runs for South Africa in all forms of the game. None of them could be described as ugly. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Can you name the bowler with the best Test figures of 2018? Didn't think so. It's time to doff your cap to South Africa left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took 9-129 against Sri Lanka in July. South Africa still lost by 199 runs. Congratulations to the Joyces. Ed, the former England batsman, called time on a distinguished 21-year career after playing in Ireland's inaugural Test in May, and his sisters Isobel and Cecelia followed suit when Ireland bowed out of the Women's World Twenty20 in November. Surrey may not be the most popular team in county cricket, but not even their harshest critics could fail to be impressed by the manner in which they dominated the County Championship this summer. They won a first title for 16 years with two games to spare - and did it thanks to 13 home-grown or academy players. An award you didn't expect to be reading about, but the England and Wales Cricket Board's decision to reduce the residency qualification rules for overseas-born players from seven years to three means we could all enjoy the supremely talented Jofra Archer - born and raised in the West Indies, now playing for Sussex - wearing an England shirt in the not-too-distant future.

He went into the game as the league's top scorer but had just 13 touches before being substituted in the 71st minute. To make matters worse, SIX of those touches were from the kick-off. Don't believe us? Here's his touch map to prove it. As the map shows, the Gabon international was only given the ball once in the Liverpool penalty area and more of his touches come in his own penalty area than Liverpool's. Aubameyang's 13 touches was his lowest total in any game he has started this season and only Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has had fewer touches when playing at least 70 minutes in the Premier League this season - he had 11 touches in 87 minutes for Leicester against Arsenal in October. Unsurprisingly, Aubameyang also made the fewest passes of any player to have played the majority of the match. He made just 10 passes although they were all successful so he ended the game as the only player with 100% passing accuracy.

Unseasonable heat in the dead of winter? Steven Gerrard's team turned up the temperature, that's for sure. Their victory was scalding and wholly deserved. After 10 defeats and two draws in 12 meetings with Brendan Rodgers' team that saw them produce performances that ran the gamut from A for Abysmal to Z for Zzzzz, Rangers finally stirred and gave Celtic a little glimpse of life on the other side. The Scottish champions turned up at Ibrox for a game of football. Rangers turned up for a battle. If this game was won, ultimately, by a goal from Ryan Jack, its foundations were built on attitude and work-rate and fitness to go like the clappers all day long, on Gerrard devising a perfect game plan that was carried out to the letter by an infinitely hungrier team. Not to mention Rodgers getting his team selection wrong and then it being exposed. The hosts hustled and harried Celtic to the point of distraction and disorientation. Dedryck Boyata, Scott Brown, Olivier Ntcham and others will wake up in the night imagining that Jack and Ross McCrorie were in the room with them, tipping them out of their bed. Scott Sinclair, Ryan Christie, James Forrest will think about the last time they were all so ineffective in a game of this kind. That'll take a while. None of Celtic's go-to men in attack were mapped.  Celtic's disintegration was something to see. Every pass - even the simple ones - became an adventure. For a spell, you waited for them to regain their composure and mount an assault down the other end, but you abandoned expectation pretty early in the day. Rangers' intensity was far, far too much for them.  Their only comfort - and it doesn't even amount to a crumb - was that they avoided the kind of outcome that would have been on sale as a DVD come Monday morning. By any reasonable analysis, on the balance of chances created, Rangers were at least three goals better than Celtic at the very minimum. Four would be closer to the mark. Five would not have flattered them.  At the end, the cameras turned to Gerrard in the most significant moment of his brief career in management. Gerrard needed this, no question. After dropping points in nine league games this season - and staring down the barrel of a six-point deficit on a Celtic team with a game in hand - he needed the validation that he was on the right track domestically. That even if Rangers don't win the league, that he shows himself capable of giving Celtic under Rodgers a bloody nose as others have done before him. Hibernian have done it, Hearts have done it, Kilmarnock have done it, Aberdeen have done it and now Rangers have joined the party at last at the 13th attempt since the Celtic manager hit town. From now until the end of the season, Gerrard can put this victory on the television screen in the team room and say, 'that's your level now, that's what your capable of, that's what we want every week, that's what will make us contenders'. For Rangers, the thought of beating Celtic is no longer an abstract thing. The win strips away a layer of Celtic's aura. Rodgers' team have now lost four league games in the first half of this season, which is the same number of losses they suffered in the past two league seasons put together. Talking about them being beatable is all well and good, but Rangers don't need to talk about it anymore. They've experienced it. The question for Gerrard is about consistency. Can he dig out displays like this on a regular basis going forward? Can he bring to an end soft points getting dropped on the road? Now that he's applying some heat to Rodgers' rear end, can he keep it applied or will a silly draw here and a weak loss there undermine it all?  The winter break is upon us but when they return to league action Rangers have a pocket of games that will tell us much about their durability in what we must now call a title race. Three points separate the top four clubs at the midway stage. How long it lasts is a moot point - Celtic remain hot favourites - but in the here and now there is a chase on for sure.  Those games facing Rangers are Kilmarnock (away), Livingston (away), St Mirren (home) and Aberdeen (away). Their travails have been mostly on the road in the Premiership this season. They've had a flakiness at Livingston, Motherwell and Dundee - where they should be winning - and it has hurt them. If they leave Rugby Park, the Tony Macaroni Arena and Pittodrie with nine points, they'll have built on what they achieved against Celtic on Saturday and the feeling will harden that, maybe, they are in this for the long haul.  There's a transfer window to negotiate in the meantime. Rangers made a \u00a314m loss in their last accounts but the temptation of seeing the whites of Celtic's eyes will surely see them spend again. Gerrard has already spoken about strengthening and his words will only take on greater persuasiveness after what happened at Ibrox. Another option up front is the first priority.  For Celtic, this should come as an awakening. They dozed their way through the summer window and their lack of action contributed heavily to their exit from the Champions League. It's now putting an element of doubt about their domestic dominance.  Mr Magoo can see what they need in the next window - one more striker, possibly two, and a right-back to replace Mikael Lustig. That's the least of it. Rangers exposed Celtic in the heart of the midfield where Brown and Ntcham were thunderously outplayed. That might give Rodgers food for thought also. He ought to be chastened by what became of his team at Ibrox. The same can be said of Peter Lawwell. The chief executive would never want Celtic to lose to Rangers, but losing so soon after it was reported that he is about to pocket a performance bonus of more than \u00a32m to go with his salary of \u00a31.1m is particularly wounding. That news will have gone down badly with the faithful, but it's grist to Rodgers' mill as he looks for proper money to reinvent his team. Like Gerrard showing his board the DVD of the game in a bid for new funds, Rodgers can do exactly the same for altogether different reasons.  The Celtic manager hasn't had many poor days in Scotland, but this was the worst of them. There's a little chink in the armoury now. And everyone can see it. ", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46663364", "content": "Burnley manager Sean Dyche says a couple of \"big decisions\" in his team selection contributed to a vital win over West Ham at Turf Moor. Goalkeeper Tom Heaton excelled after being recalled at the expense of Joe Hart and 19-year-old Dwight McNeil, also included as one of five changes to the side thumped 5-1 by Everton on Boxing Day, scored the Clarets' second goal. \"Joe has been magnificent for us and credit to him because he was the first to jump up at the end when Tom makes a big save,\" said Dyche, who had seen his side lose their previous three league matches.  \"I decided the time was right for Dwight, who is a clever player who has some quality and ability. His family should take some pride in what he's doing. He'll get stronger and fitter and we hope he'll continue growing with the team.\" Chris Wood put Burnley in charge with a right-footed finish from the left of the penalty area to conclude a sweeping move involving Heaton, Ashley Westwood, McNeil and Ashley Barnes. And with the hosts repeatedly carving through the visitors, they pressed home their advantage before the interval, when 19-year-old McNeil turned in Westwood's cross at the far post.  It was a disappointing end to a strong December for West Ham, who arrived in Lancashire on the back of five wins from six games. Despite the return of Marko Arnautovic, playing for the first time since injuring his hamstring at Cardiff on 4 December, Manuel Pellegrini's side were sluggish throughout with their best chance, a header from substitute Andy Carroll, drawing a fine save from Heaton late on.  The only crumb of comfort for the Hammers was that both Wood and Barnes spurned several excellent opportunities after the break to make Burnley's win more emphatic. The win lifts Burnley above Fulham into 18th and level on points with 17th-placed Southampton, who lost to Manchester City.  A run of six defeats from their last seven games has raised question marks over Dyche's position for the first time in his six-year tenure.  While the club finished seventh in the Premier League last season, that success was largely built on a solid defensive base. In contrast, the defence has been porous this term - leaking 41 goals so far, two more than the entire 2017-18 campaign. And with failed attempts to combat that problem including the deployment of five defenders in their last three matches - all ending in defeats - Dyche reverted to type with a 4-4-2 formation. Wood and Barnes offered physicality in a two-man attack and club captain Heaton's return to the line-up proved inspired.  Over 15 months had elapsed since Heaton dislocated his shoulder at Crystal Palace - the last time he featured in a league game for Burnley - but the 32-year-old exerted his influence on those in front of him, barking out instructions and providing organisation and leadership. That contributed to West Ham managing just four shots on target and Heaton's understanding with his team-mates was evident as he raced out of his goal in the 15th minute to instigate the move that ended with Wood's goal. Heaton positioned himself to calmly head the ball to Westwood under pressure from West Ham attackers, and he underscored a good day's work by superbly tipping Carroll's header on to the woodwork late on. A position just outside the top six felt like an implausible proposition for West Ham after they lost their opening four games but Pellegrini's side had the opportunity to move up to seventh at kick-off.  Instead this turned into a second blip in an otherwise fruitful December, their other defeat this month, against Watford, also a 2-0 reverse. \"It was frustrating because we wanted to win this game and had the chance to be seventh but we lacked energy to win it,\" Pellegrini said. \"We had a flight that arrived at 2am in the morning after playing Southampton. I was happy until two o'clock today. This was a game we were able to win - Burnley was in a bad moment but they played with intensity. Burnley recovered better because they had 30 or 35 hours' more [rest].\" Brazilian midfielder Felipe Anderson has played a principal role in West Ham's upturn but he struggled to make an impact against well-drilled and determined opponents. Anderson won just 31% of his duels and his passing accuracy was also below par at 64%. And with West Ham's most creative player on the periphery it allowed Burnley to assume control.   Anderson was far from the only visiting player to underwhelm, though. Lucas Perez and Robert Snodgrass were withdrawn at half-time after ineffective displays, which contributed to the visitors managing just one shot in the first period.  The introduction of Carroll did add power and presence but the Hammers were unable to provide the aerial service he thrives on until the closing minutes.

Impact. Shock. A familiar crumple of leather and bone. And then panic. Ian Hutchinson, with a mantelpiece full of trophies but a body full of pain, is back lying in the middle of the road. He doesn't know why he's crashed, but he knows that his leg is badly broken. Again. Ian Hutchinson, with 30 major operations already behind him and with 50 hours on the operating table already in the tank, knows he's now got more to come. But first he's got to get out of the way.  Ian Hutchinson, who came close to having a foot amputated after a 2010 crash which shattered the same leg which is now twisted at a sickening angle, has just seconds before the next motorbike racing the famous Isle of Man TT course comes past at over 100mph. He levers himself to the roadside despite having a visibly shattered femur, narrowly avoiding the fast arriving Norton of Dave Johnson.  His storied career could have been ended on that sunny Isle of Man afternoon. But instead, after another gruelling year of recovery and rehab, Hutchison will go for a 17th TT win this weekend. Why?  Because, in his own words, \"Life's made for a challenge, isn't it?\" 'You're not amputating my foot! I need it' To understand the full scale of Hutchinson's personal ride through the peaks and troughs of life as a road racer, we need to first rewind to the autumn of 2010. After six years of progress, the then 30-year-old was at the top of his game after becoming the first rider in history to win all five TT races in a single week.  He sold up, capitalising on the prize money to move into a dream house which needed major renovations - and within a few months he was in the same boat. A freak crash in the rain at Silverstone saw a fellow rider run over his leg, causing major damage which would rule out much of the next five years of Hutchinson's career. \"It was high-energy open fracture, it came out of the skin,\" he says. \"My leg was in a million bits. \"When it first happens you don't have any pain, you are in shock. I looked down and could see bones sticking out the back of my leathers and my leg just dangling down. Then you panic. \"The three arteries feeding my foot with blood weren't working. So they were going to amputate my foot. My foot was dead. \"They were showing me my foot and it was purple but I didn't know what they were on about, I just kept saying 'you're not taking it off. I'll never ride a bike again.'\" Hutchinson's persistence won out - not for the first time in this story - and his foot was saved. Enter surgeon Matija Krkovic, who attached a metal cage - a Taylor spatial frame - around Hutchinson's mangled leg and started the slow, painful process of rebuilding his tibia. Or to be more accurate, regrowing it from scratch. The cage holds bone fragments in place with wires through the skin which are then turned every six hours, forcing the bone apart and promoting new bone to grow. Each day brings growth of 1mm. Each cm of new bone then takes a further month to consolidate. In three separate sessions since his 2010 accident Hutchinson has now grown 210mm of new bone in his left leg. Over eight inches.  \"At the start with the cage on it's horrible,\" says Hutchinson, who has now spent 1,200 days since the autumn of 2010 with the contraption on his leg. \"You can't sleep. You're up all night on morphine, you're drowsy all day.  \"I'd just peaked in my career in 2010, everything was going so well. I'd been putting everything into racing for so long and I'd just got there and it was all taken away from me.  \"The first time I did have doubts if I could carry on. I thought 'should I be really doing this?'\" The injury of 2010 started a period of almost three years of rebuilding for Hutchinson. He missed the 2011 season, had the cage removed and signed up to race in 2012 before breaking the leg again in an accident at a bike show when he slipped on a concrete floor. He didn't know it at the time, but Hutchinson was approaching his lowest point of all. \"I slipped off a little kid's motocross bike,\" he said. \"I didn't know the leg was broken again. \"I walked away, at that point I thought my leg was fixed for good. But I had the frame back on, they said it would be three months. \"That was the beginning of February 2012 and it should have been removed for the second time just in time for the TT that year. I went back on 30 April for an X-ray, expecting the frame to come off that day, and they said the bone was infected. It was weak and that is why it had broken. \"They told me they were going to have to remove a big piece of bone and start all over again. That was the lowest point, the closest I came to crying. They said it would be another 18 months to fix it.\" It can take a rider years to learn the TT course, with each 37.7-mile lap containing 227 corners which carve a route through villages and across the Snaefell mountain, the riders hitting 200mph at parts - all on public roads. It is an unforgiving place. Just this week local rider Dan Kneen became the 149th rider to lose their life in the event's 111-year history. Having already missed the 2011 race, Hutchinson knew that missing 2012 could be the end of his career. So he decided to race anyway - despite his busted leg - postponing his next battle with the cage and covering his injury with a homemade cast that was thin enough to go under his leathers. \"I had to keep my eye in and race that year,\" he said. \"The plaster cast was far too thick so I had some carbon fibre in the garage and made my own cast which was 2mm thick. \"I didn't tell anyone what had happened, I just told them that my leg was fixed. I couldn't tell anybody, I wouldn't have been able to race. \"Potentially that was stupid. I asked the surgeon if racing would cause any more damage and he said 'your leg is in such a mess anyway, if you crash it will pull it off.' \"I said 'if I crash at the TT my leg will be the least of my worries.'\" Hutchinson did not crash in 2012 - managing a top-six finish despite his problems - but came back with his leg in a 'horrendous' state. His tibia, weakened by infection, had bent in on itself by 26 degrees. And so it was under the knife again, as surgeon Krkovic cut out the section which they had grown from scratch and restarted the process. Back into the cage, which would not be removed until September 2013. More pain, more gain, and with a newly-grown left leg once more, Hutchinson had a turning point when he won at the 2013 Macau Grand Prix, a victory which gave belief to not only him, but also teams and sponsors, that he could be a winner again. Even then there was more disappointment as the 2014 season was written off, not through injury for once but a bike that Hutchinson could not get on with. But he was now fit to compete again - and in 2015 he finally ascended the mountain to win three races at the TT. \"Winning again felt amazing,\" he says. \"When I was coming up over the mountain knowing that I was going to win a TT I was thinking back to lying in a hospital bed in tatters, drugged out of my mind on morphine. \"All the work I'd gone through for that five years. I just thought 'I can't actually believe I'm going to win again'. It was really, really weird. The most emotional race ever.\" It was no fluke - a year later Hutchinson broke the lap record in practice and went on to win three more races. He was once again at the very top of his game. Hutchinson won two races at the 2017 TT to move to 16 wins overall and cement his place among the greatest road racers of all time. And then - the crash. He was battling for the lead of the Senior TT when he lost control of his BMW and ploughed into the side of the road. A year on, he still doesn't know why he crashed, with some images suggesting he may have had a puncture. After hitting the wall at over 100mph he was hit by his rebounding superbike, breaking his femur and smashing his ankle. How did he find the strength to move out of the way? \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         \"When you've been ridden over before you don't want it to happen again so I knew I had to get out of the road,\" he says. \"My leg was bent right out to the side, but I had to get out of the way, so I just dragged myself. The bikes would be coming in a few seconds and would be doing over 100mph there, which is pretty fast when you're sat on the floor. \"The first bike to come by was very close, if I hadn't have managed to move he would have hit me.\" High up on the mountain roads of the Isle of Man, Hutchinson was in agony. Luckily a helicopter with medics on board arrived within six minutes of his accident. \"Some people have said that I must have a high pain threshold but it does hurt, it's not like I can't feel it!\" he says. \"But there's no point in complaining or crying, it's not going to fix anything so just deal with it. \"When the medics came I kept saying 'I need ketamine, I need ketamine'. Eventually I passed out.\" When he awoke in hospital in Liverpool there was a further surprise. \"When I came back from theatre my femur was the same as when I went in. They said we've never seen a bone smashed as bad and we don't know what to do. \"I said 'this is it this time, it's not fixable'. It didn't look like a bone any more, just fragments.\" But after a phone call to Krkovic, Hutchinson had his femur plated and was transferred down to his old surgeon and friend, who set about cutting into his left tibia once again. Because Krkovic had to remove the talus bone from inside Hutchinson's ankle - which had lost all blood supply in the accident and would subsequently die - his tibia had to be broken artificially so that it could be lengthened to make up the shortfall. With Hutchinson also losing some of his femur in the crash, it means that his knees are now not at the same level.  After years of surgery and pain, did he consider retirement this time? What do you think? \"As soon as I came round, I knew I wanted to make it back for the TT in 2018. That's all I was bothered about,\" he said. \"If I wasn't winning races then I wouldn't have pushed to get back. It's not racing that's addictive, it's success. \"I have won the same amount of TTs after my accident in 2010 as I had before. I haven't forgotten how to ride fast. I've been more successful on my comeback than I was before. It makes me know that I can do it again this time.\" And so for the last year Hutchinson has battled through his familiar world of rehab and surgery, slowly growing bone in his same scarred left leg and edging closer to fitness week by week with a punishing, lonely gym schedule. There was still time for one more dice with death, though, as on two occasions Hutchinson was hit by massive blood clots in his lungs. \"Your femur holds a lot of blood so when you break it, it quite often forms a clot which can go into your heart and lungs.  \"They were so painful, it's like being stabbed. Bang, all of a sudden it's like a knife going in. Your lungs collapse. \"I was home alone the second time and it took an hour for the ambulance to come - I thought I was going to die.\" But the great survivor is back on a bike. He had his latest cage removed last month and was able to race at the North West 200 just a matter of days later. He will again be one of the star names on display at the TT this week. It's been quite the journey, but despite all his lows, Hutchinson is hoping for more highs to come.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45476430", "content": "It is October 2011 and 15-year-old George Green is travelling to London for a trial with Tottenham Hotspur when a phone call changes everything. Everton have agreed a \u00a32m deal with Bradford City for the schoolboy midfielder. Green signs a two-and-a-half-year contract, receives a \u00a345,000 signing-on fee in three instalments of \u00a315,000, and a promising future with the Toffees beckons for the Dewsbury teenager. Four years later he is standing on railway tracks near his hometown waiting for the next train so that he can end his life, Green's hopes of making it as a Premier League player ruined by cocaine and alcohol. \"I was in that much debt, I thought I'd lost my partner because of my drug use, and I didn't see a way back for me with football,\" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport. Now at sixth-tier Chester, who beat City of Liverpool 4-0 in the FA Cup second qualifying round on Saturday, Green opens up about having too much too soon, self-destruction, depression and how he is attempting to rebuild his life. \"Mental health and addiction is an everyday battle. I'm giving it my best shot,\" he says. \"If others can learn from it, I'd rather help.\" It was Everton Under-21s boss David Unsworth who broke the news to a tearful Green, then aged 19, he was no longer required after a loan at League Two Tranmere Rovers in 2015. He had arrived at Goodison Park a fresh-faced schoolboy and was quickly compared to Wayne Rooney, who made his senior debut for the club aged 16. Green left without playing a first-team game having spent five weeks of his four years at Goodison Park in London's Priory hospital, which provides a range of mental health and addictions treatments. \"Everton paid for it all, I think it was about \u00a35,000-a-week,\" said Green, who was playing in the Toffees' U21 side by the age of 16 alongside future England internationals John Stones and Ross Barkley. \"Before I turned 18 you wouldn't catch me out at night. As soon as I was 18 it was like a new world opened up. I was drinking, doing drugs and playing football. \"The first time I took drugs I'd gone to watch football in a pub with mates. I was offered cocaine and it changed my life.\" At first Green was able to hide his habit from the likes of Kevin Sheedy, his youth-team coach, but before long he was taking 30 grams a month and life was spiralling out of control. \"I was spending way over \u00a32,000 a month. I remember one particular Monday morning I was supposed to be training. I didn't wake up until the afternoon. \"The night before I'd gone to a friend's house for drink and drugs. I think that's when alarm bells started ringing at Everton. \"I remember phoning a welfare officer at Everton one night. I was crying and said 'I need help'. Soon after I was admitted to the Priory.\" Having joined Everton as a \u00a3150-a-week schoolboy, Green's earnings reached \u00a3110,000-a-year at the Premier League club. Since leaving three years ago, he has also had spells with Burnley and Oldham Athletic - as well as Viking in Norway's top flight under Englishman Ian Burchnall, now boss at Swedish side Ostersunds. Green, who has also featured in the Scottish Premiership for Kilmarnock, believes he has earned at least \u00a3500,000 playing football. \"I have an iPad to show for it. That's how much of a downfall my life has become because of drugs,\" he added. \"I squandered it all. I'm embarrassed.\" At Everton, the former England youth international did most of his socialising back home in Yorkshire.  \"A good night out? I'd easily spend about \u00a31,500. A meal would cost between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300,\" he said. \"I'd be like 'let's get a bottle of champagne' and then a girl would come and sit next to me and I'd be like 'would you like a bottle of champagne?' \"Earning the money I was, I thought it was never going to end.  \"Everybody wanted to know who I was and I was enjoying life. But I never got introduced to people who would keep me on the straight and narrow. They drank or did drugs and I fell into that circle. \"I got a brand new Mercedes-Benz A-Class and did about \u00a34,000 damage to it. That stemmed from drink-driving. I was ridiculous, I used to drink-drive everywhere.\" Green had four clubs within 14 months of leaving Everton. Soon after his release from the Toffees, he joined League One Oldham on a two-year deal. He lasted five months before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in November 2015. \"It was due to drink and drugs, I'd fallen out of love with the game and decided I didn't want to play any more.\" By now, Green was on a downward spiral. He had a drink-driving conviction and, after blowing much of his earnings on alcohol and cocaine, he was struggling financially. In addition, he was suffering from depression.  He did not stay away from football for long. A week after leaving Oldham, Green had signed for non-league Yorkshire side Ossett Albion for \u00a380-a-game. He had gone from Everton to the eighth tier of English football in less than six months. It was around this time he first contemplated suicide.  \"Leaving Everton hit me hard,\" he said. \"I was stood on a railway track close to Mirfield station near Dewsbury ready for a train to come. I remember it being around eight or nine o'clock at night.  \"I hadn't written a note. It was all the pressures of everything in my life. The drugs, the alcohol, my mental health, football wasn't going well, lack of money. \"Then there was an announcement over the speakers that the next train was delayed. \"I thought 'it must be a sign that it can't be my time to go'. I broke down in tears and walked away.\" Green's mental health problems continued. He took an overdose after joining Salford City on loan from Burnley in early 2017. \"I went in the pill cupboard at home and took everything there was. I wanted to die at that time,\" he added.  Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Salford's co-owner, offered his support. Green said: \"I was invited round to his house. I had been in hospital for taking too many tablets. We spoke for an hour about football and things Salford could do to help me.\" He lives near Dewsbury with his two-year-old daughter Daisy and fiancee, Charli, while the couple are due to welcome a baby boy to the family in October. Gone are the flash cars and the hangers-on who formed part of his life when he was at Everton. Instead of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Green now drives a Kia Rio to and from Chester, the club he joined in July from National League North rivals Nuneaton. Money is tight but the player blames no-one but himself. He relapsed in April but says he has not touched drink or drugs since, and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous meetings.  Green's support network includes former Aston Villa and England defender Gary Charles, a recovering alcoholic who now has a business which provides care to people who are experiencing a wide range of problems, including depression and alcohol/drug dependency. \"There's not a day I don't speak to him. He's a lifesaver,\" adds Green. At the time of this interview, Green has an additional battle in his life. Two months after signing, he has yet to make his Chester debut because of a back injury which is likely to require surgery. He's frustrated and impatient.  He has kept himself busy by getting to know Chester fans at home games, signing autographs and posing for pictures. Chester, a fan-owned club with a community trust, run a weekly mental health and wellbeing session which offers vulnerable members of society a chance to get out and play football. Green hopes opening up about his problems will raise awareness of mental health and addiction issues. \"Football is the only thing I am good at. Without it I'd be dead,\" he added. \"I thought my career would be over if I came out and started talking about my issues with drugs.  \"Then I said to myself 'how about being honest for once in your life and admit your problems'. \"If my story helps one person, I'm happy to tell it. I'm happier, healthier and way more positive than I was.\" If you have been affected by any of the issues discussed in this article, advice and support can be accessed here.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44360546", "content": "When Gareth Southgate was first put in charge of the England team, one national newspaper described the public reaction as a \"mass wail of despair\". After the debacle of losing to Iceland at Euro 2016 and the embarrassment of Sam Allardyce's tenure, England had turned to what looked to be the safe, corporate option. Not only that, Southgate's only previous senior managerial experience involved taking Middlesbrough down from the Premier League, then getting sacked. But he has barely put a foot wrong as he prepares to lead his country into Saturday's World Cup quarter-final with Sweden.  Qualification for Russia was achieved without alarm, the end of Wayne Rooney's international career was handled with kid gloves, and he has even guided England to a penalty shootout win. Clear-thinking, straight-talking and appearing to be a thoroughly decent bloke, Southgate has somehow got England to a World Cup quarter-final with optimism and realism in equal measure. Here, the people who know him best speak of the real Southgate. From being advised to become a travel agent, to throwing up over the Crystal Palace chairman, Euro '96 and beyond. Southgate, a boyhood Manchester United fan, attended Pound Hill Junior School and Hazelwick School, both in Crawley, Sussex. He has said both schools were \"fundamental\" in him taking up football, largely because of his PE teachers. Dave Palmer taught Southgate at Hazelwick. He was very self-assured. I remember the last chat I had with him as a schoolboy. We were talking about the future and I was asking the boys what they would be doing the following year.  Gareth said \"I'm at Crystal Palace\" and it dawned on me that was what he would be doing. As a 16-year-old, he was talking with absolute certainty.  In those days, 60-odd boys used to turn up for football trials when they joined the school. He stood out straight away because he was so classy and had so much time. He used to glide around the pitch. He was a multi-talented sportsman. He played rugby for the school, to the extent that when we went on a football and rugby tour to France, Gareth played both sports. He was quite quick, 200m was his best track event, but he also won the county championship and held the school record in the triple jump. He was mature, had a good a sense of humour and a big smile. He was respected by his peers and teachers. He was very thoughtful and clever, as well as having a sharp wit. He set himself him high expectations in everything he did, either in the classroom or on the sports field. There's always a discussion when someone has so many different talents about where they take their life. He could have taken an academic route, or a sporting route. So many boys I've known have had high hopes in football, but there's never any certainty. Gareth was sure he was on the right path. Southgate was released by Southampton as a youngster. He came to the attention of Palace youth-team manager Alan Smith, who would later make him captain of the first team. Even after they both left Palace, Southgate and Smith remained close. Southgate visited Smith within 24 hours of missing his Euro '96 penalty and later, when manager of Middlesbrough, took Smith to Teesside as an advisor. I had a doubt whether or not he had a career in professional football in him. We had one particular game, which we lost, and I called him into the office and said: \"Gareth, I think you're too bright to do this job. I think you have to make a choice. If it was my choice, I think you should become a travel agent.\" He was upset, but he took it on board. Instead of releasing him, I decided to go the other way and made him captain of the youth team, because I thought he had leadership qualities. Not because of what he said, but the way he went about his job. I introduced him to an estate agent friend of mine that got him to do some work after training. He was measuring up, mundane stuff, looking to see if a property could be marketed or not. All of these things help build the character that you become. It opened his eyes to what was out there and showed him what is was like to deal with people outside football. I was there when he threw up over the chairman, Ron Noades. It was a trip abroad and I had let the lads out for one night. Ron had his white shoes on and Gareth managed to do it. I heard plenty about it from Ron the next day. I can't repeat what Ron's words were, but I do know Gareth was very apologetic. No-one can say he has had it easy. He has had to fight for everything he has got, even if he did come from a middle-class Crawley background. To miss the penalty at Euro 1996, to be sacked by Middlesbrough, these are things that chip away from you. They have made him a stronger character. I know he went for one manager's job many years ago and he didn't get it because he was told he was too polite. He has principles. That does put him slightly aside from others. He has a real loyalty. He hasn't forgotten his roots. These are all things that make up his DNA that have led him to the England job. Southgate played every minute of England's Euro '96 campaign, which ended with his penalty miss against Germany. When he became England manager, he said he did not think he would ever have to go through a worse experience. Alan Shearer was part of the England team that night at Wembley. Not long ago, I made a documentary about Euro '96 and I asked Gareth if I could speak to him. He politely declined because he knew that one thing we wanted to talk about was the penalty miss and he'd had enough of it. Still to this day it will be hurting him. He took a penalty because he's brave. The manager was looking around for characters and one or two put their heads down, not wanting to take a penalty. That wasn't Gareth. After the five designated penalty takers were allotted, the manager was asking 'who's after that?' and Gareth stuck his hand up. I would never criticise anyone that has the courage, the balls, to put his hand up to take a penalty, particularly in those circumstances. When you have 90,000 in the stadium, 10 or 15 million watching on TV, it takes a certain character to put his hand up to take a penalty. There was nothing that I or anyone else could say to make him feel any better. Two years later we were at France '98. Tournaments can be a bit boring, doing the same thing for four or five weeks. We came up with the idea to fit as many song titles as possible into the interviews that we gave. Because the players' room was next door to the TV room and the interviews were going out live, once we got the song title in, you could hear a roar when the players realised you'd done it.  Gareth managed to sneak Club Tropicana and Careless Whispers into an interview with Bob Wilson. He was definitely one of the brighter ones, so he was better at that than most. He was certainly better at song titles than he was at taking penalties.  Southgate had caught the eye of Sven-Goran Eriksson when the Swede was manager of Lazio. When Eriksson became England manager in 2001, he had to manage Southgate's disappointment at falling behind the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell. Southgate was part of the England squad for the 2002 World Cup, but did not play a single minute. He won the last of his 57 caps against Sweden in 2004, two years before the end of Eriksson's spell in charge. He came to me and asked for a meeting. He wanted to know how to make himself better. That's not easy, to keep working, on and on to make yourself better than players like Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand. It's a little unusual. In my experience, players don't come to the manager. He wants to resolve problems with talks, more than with shouting. It was easy to speak to him. He was never angry or irritated, he was always very polite.  I could see that he was a thinking man. He thought about the training we did, why we did something in a certain way. You could see that he lived for football. He was very eager to learn and I wouldn't be surprised if at that time he was thinking of being a manager in the future. I have had many players who are not interested who the opponent is, they just want to play, but he was never the sort of player that did his training, then left without thinking about it. I'm quite sure he took it home with him. When you have players like that, you can see in the future they will be coaches or managers. When he was a player, he was already like a manager, a coach. I'm sure that Southgate, in the past, has talked to a lot of managers with a lot of experience, trying to find out secrets and advice. He is a good talker, but an even better listener. Southgate ended his playing career to become Middlesbrough manager in the summer of 2006. At 35, he was the youngest manager in the Premier League. He guided Boro to 12th and 13th over the following two seasons, but presided over their relegation in 2009. He was sacked on 21 October 2009, despite the club lying fourth in the Championship. Michael Caulfield was the Boro psychologist from soon after Southgate was appointed until they were relegated from the top flight. When he was still playing, his Boro team-mates nicknamed him 'Insurance'. George Boateng said whatever happened up the field, they knew they had Gareth behind them, ready to be used if needed, like an insurance policy. He went from being a player in the May to the manager in June, so the dynamic had to change. He understood he couldn't be their best mate, but the players knew he was of good character and he would treat them right. One day, I took him to see some cricket - Durham v Sussex in Chester-le-Street. It was a low-scoring game and we sat in the Sussex dressing room, watching their batsmen waiting to go in. He turned to me and said: \"I admire these athletes, because they have too much thinking time. How must it feel to watch wickets fall, knowing that you're next? That is so different to what footballers have to do.\" He spoke to them, wanting to know how they coped with it. He never stopped asking questions, trying to learn. Not once did he talk about himself. Gareth is brave. Not the physical bravery of leading your country into war, but the kind that means he will always front up.  In our last home game of the 2008-09 season, we had to beat Aston Villa otherwise it was pretty certain that we'd go down. We only drew 1-1. When the final whistle was greeted with boos and jeers, a lot of managers would have shaken hands then disappeared down the tunnel. Gareth marched into the centre circle to applaud the fans. Even though he wasn't being well received, he made sure he turned to all four corners of the ground. It was fight or flight and he never looked back. Southgate replaced Allardyce after one game of England's World Cup qualifying campaign in the autumn of 2016. They secured their place in Russia in October 2017 with a game to spare but then changed their system. Assistant manager Steve Holland has been with Southgate throughout his tenure as England boss. One of the things he identified on taking the job was there was an issue on the back of the Iceland defeat and previous tournaments. I'd be fair in saying the sum of the mass didn't quite balance with what it delivered. Why was that? Was it handling a pressure situation that left the players not delivering what they do for their clubs? He has gone about trying to change that. We have a link with the Marines that is beyond climbing up trees and running through mud, but how these guys drop into other countries in the middle of the night and handle the pressure of if they are one step out of the plan, they get shot. They know what really is pressure, how to handle that, and we have learned from that. In terms of watching England players in club football, I'm sure England staff in the past have been 100% committed, but it's impossible that any of them have watched more matches than we have done this year. The same is possible, maybe, but not more. If there's an early kick-off and a late on Saturday, we'll do two games. Regularly, there's Tuesday and Wednesday in the Champions League, then Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Every Monday morning, after a weekend of fixtures, we'll meet to discuss the games that we've watched.  We went to the Confederations Cup in the summer of 2017 and had the chance to discuss how England had been playing. We'd played a 4-2-3-1 formation in qualifying. We watched potential opponents - Germany played 3-4-3. We were looking at the opposition, trying to imagine where our team stood up against them.  We made some decisions that we felt would take the team to the next phase. We still had to qualify, so we didn't want to bring those changes in too early. Once we qualified, we had a game to spare, and we used that game to play with three centre-halves. That is what we have done ever since. A version of this feature was first published before the World Cup on 11 June 2018", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/45463018", "content": "Standing a few feet away from the Grand Slam trophy which she had just won, Naomi Osaka started crying. The 20-year-old Japanese had just beaten her childhood idol Serena Williams, bidding for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title and her first since giving birth, in the US Open final. Still wearing the black visor she had worn throughout the 6-2 6-4 victory, Osaka - the first player from Japan to win a major tournament - pulled it down over her face to cover the emotion. During what should have been the happiest moment of her career, they did not seem to be tears of joy. Boos rang around Arthur Ashe Stadium - not directed her, but at a sense of injustice felt by most of the 24,000 crowd against American superstar Williams. \"I felt bad at one point because I'm crying and she's crying. You know, she just won,\" said former world number one Williams, 36. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said on BBC Radio 5 live: \"This was the most bizarre match and presentation I have ever seen.\" So, how did it get to that point? \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         From the moment an image of Williams emerging from the locker room appeared on the big screen there was an expectant, partisan atmosphere inside Ashe. Serena might be a global superstar but more pertinently she is an American idol: appearing on television commercials, plastered across huge billboards on New York's Fifth Avenue. Tell anyone you meet in the city that you're here to cover the US Open and it brings up one topic: Serena. \"You've watched Serena? Wow, that's so cool. I'm not really into tennis but I love Serena.\" They love her. So, as her mind started to unravel and the match quickly followed, it was unsurprising to hear the mood of the New York crowd turn. Murmurs of dissent were first heard when Williams, who had already lost the first set at Flushing Meadows, was given a code violation at 2-1 in the second after chair umpire Carlos Ramos ruled that her coach Patrick Mouratoglou was signalling tactics from the stands - which is not allowed. Williams was seriously irked. \"We don't have any code,\" she told the Portuguese. \"I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose.\" After the match, Mouratoglou admitted in a television interview he had been coaching - but added \"I don't think she looked at me\" and \"everybody does it\". If the pair do not have a code, as Williams says, and if she did not see him make any signals, then she has a right to feel aggrieved - but with her coach, not the rule book. The United States Tennis Association, which runs the tournament, issued a statement later on Saturday backing Ramos. It said he acted \"in accordance to the rules\". While Williams says she wants to \"clarify\" what Mouratoglou was thinking and saying, the Frenchman cannot be blamed for her anger escalating. The Ashe crowd has often sensed when Williams needs their backing the most, with huge roars when she trailed 30-0 on serve at key moments against Karolina Pliskova and Anastasija Sevastova helping her turn those games around on the way to victories earlier in the tournament. Again they showed their support as Williams, now pumped and finding her shots, broke Osaka's serve for the only time in the match in the fourth game. But when Williams lost her serve in the following game, the mood changed completely. First, the American smashed her racquet, and when Ramos gave her another violation - again a correct one - she exploded. \"I didn't get coaching. You need to make an announcement that I don't cheat. You owe me an apology,\" she told the umpire. \"I have never cheated in my life. I have a daughter and I stand for what's right for her. I have never cheated.\" By now Ramos was getting the sort of treatment reserved for a pantomime villain. From that point it was a matter of when, not if, Osaka went on to clinch victory. She broke serve again for a 4-3 lead and then more drama unfolded when Williams continued to rant at Ramos. \"You stole a point from me. You are a thief,\" the 36-year-old said. That earned Williams a third violation for verbal abuse, Ramos announcing he had penalised her a game as a sense of confusion and disbelief swept around the stadium. An emotional Williams remonstrated further with Ramos and called for the tournament referee in what was rapidly becoming a chaotic situation. Those pantomime boos quickly turned more menacing, however. Loud jeers rained down on to the court. Some spectators were on their feet, some had their thumbs pointing down, and some shouted abuse at the Portuguese umpire. Osaka, somehow, maintained her cool. \"I didn't really hear anything because I had my back turned,\" she said. On all three counts, Ramos correctly penalised Williams by the letter of the law. According to ITF Grand Slam rules: However, Chris Evert, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion, said Ramos should have used common sense. \"Because of the big occasion - finals, the score, a game penalty - he should have warned her,\" the American told BBC Radio 5 live. \"Scold her. 'Ms Williams you need to be quiet because if you keep going on like this it will be a game.' \"Because of the enormity of the moment he should have given her a little bit of a break - but instead he just went right for the jugular.\" Ramos was not the only one going \"for the jugular\" - so did Osaka. Although Williams held to love immediately after the game penalty, the Japanese 20th seed maintained the composure she had showed from the start to take her second match point. That was the moment Osaka, who was brought up in New York after her family moved over from Japan, had dreamed of since picking up a racquet - beating her idol in a Grand Slam final. \"When I hugged Serena at the net I felt like a little kid again,\" said Osaka, who later revealed she made a school report on Williams in third grade. Still it felt like it was not the special moment it should have been. Boos continued to be heard at the end of the match and again when the presentation began. Osaka began to cry - a heart-wrenching moment which was hard to watch. That's when Williams, 16 years older than her opponent, intervened as her maternal instinct kicked in. \"Let's not boo any more,\" she pleaded. \"Congratulations Naomi. No more booing.\" The crowd responded and the jeers turned to cheers as Osaka took the microphone. \"I know everyone was cheering for her and I am sorry it has to end like this,\" she said. Humility and a sweet innocence off the court, but explosive hitting and steeliness on it, one imagines Osaka will have more Grand Slam victories to savour in the future. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: \"This must be the most surreal experience. A worthy champion but sadly for her it will be remembered for a very, very different story.\" Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash on BBC Radio 5 live: \"This was the most bizarre match and presentation I have ever seen.\" Former US Open champion Andy Roddick: \"Common sense should've prevailed in my opinion. He's within his power to make that call. I've seen an umpire borderline coach a player up, and another dock a game for being called a thief in same tourney. There needs to be some continuity in the future.\"", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46712597", "content": "Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said it would be \"crazy\" for the club's fans not to be enjoying their nine-point lead in the Premier League - but played down his side's title chances.

Riccardo Saponara thought he had taken a point, but the goal was ruled out. Cristiano Ronaldo scored early on, and later put his side back in front with a penalty that was awarded for a handball which did not look deliberate. Samp's equaliser came from a penalty awarded after consultation with VAR. Former Juve striker Fabio Quagliarella hammered home the spot-kick after referee Paolo Valeri took instruction from his assistant following Emre Can's handball from a corner. Elsewhere, 10-man AC Milan scored for the first time in five league games to complete a comeback victory over SPAL. Andrea Petagna gave the struggling visitors a 13th-minute lead at the San Siro, but Samu Castillejo equalised three minutes later before Gonzalo Higuain completed the scoring in the second half.

Spurs led through Harry Kane's spectacular 25-yard strike in the first half but Wolves punished a poor second-half performance, scoring three times in the final 18 minutes to end their hosts' five-game winning run. The north London side would have moved only three points behind leaders Liverpool with a win, but the defeat and the Reds' 5-1 win over Arsenal means the Merseyside club ended the day nine points clear. \"We have had a very good run in the last few weeks and to keep that level is difficult,\" said Pochettino, whose side won 6-2 and 5-0 against Everton and Bournemouth respectively in their last two games. \"We tried to play a little more in the second half, but we were too direct and I think we started to pay for the effort in the other games.  \"We are not machines. We need to understand that we cannot get ourselves in this situation.\" Willy Boly brought the visitors level with a powerful header in the 72nd minute and Raul Jimenez then beat Hugo Lloris with a weak effort from the edge of the area to put Wolves in front. Helder Costa added a third on the counter-attack three minutes from time. Spurs, who did not have a single shot in the second half, remain second in the table but Manchester City can go back above them when they visit Southampton on Sunday. Spurs' performance in the second half was in a stark contrast to their previous two games, when they scored 11 goals. That free-scoring form had led manager Pochettino to admit his side were \"intruders\" in the title race, but a fifth league defeat of the season halts the momentum they had built. The north London side played well in the first half and had 10 efforts on goal, though most - including Kane's goal - came from distance. Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min were particularly lively. But after the break they were flat and lacked cohesion, the influence of Kane, Son and Eriksen diminished, and the introduction of Lucas Moura failed to spark them into life. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The tension inside Wembley increased as the home support witnessed their team lose control of the game as Wolves, who had barely threatened in the first half, grew in confidence. After Boly's deserved equaliser, the Spurs fans tried to squeeze more from their team but it was Wolves, helped by some slack defending, who created all of the chances late on. \"We did not dominate the ball in the second half,\" Pochettino said.  \"We were wrong in the way we tried to play, too much long ball and our energy dropped in the second half.\" Wolves' fans, players and manager Nuno Espirito Santo celebrated wildly at full-time. They did not create chances in the opening 45 minutes but, unlike Everton and Bournemouth before them, defended well enough to stay in the game. Then, when Spurs' performance dipped, they began to exert control on the game and Nuno made the right substitutions. Joao Moutinho was introduced to the base of midfield in the 68th minute and dictated play, as well as providing the pin-point cross from the set-piece for Boly's equaliser. Striker Costa, meanwhile, came on in the 59th minute and made an excellent run before a clinical low finish to seal the game with Wolves' third goal. Victory means they jump to seventh in the table, one place and three points behind Manchester United. They began 2018 as a promotion-chasing Championship side but end it as a team in the top half of the Premier League with a famous win over a title contender. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         \"It is good for the dressing room but to play like this at Wembley - the home of football - is the big thing,\" Nuno said. \"We have achieved something very special in getting to the Premier League and it has been a very special year. \"The second half was really really good. We managed possession, had chances and goals. \"We had a lot of belief after the equaliser - I would have said a draw was a good result, but I cannot control the emotions of the boys if they see space in front of them.\" Tottenham's next game is on New Year's Day at Cardiff (17:30 GMT).

The pair argued and designated spot-kick taker Mitrovic was furious after Kamara refused to give him the ball. \"He did not respect me, the club, team-mates and crowd. I spoke with him, it is not right,\" Ranieri told BBC Sport. Mitrovic, though, rescued the Cottagers with an injury-time winner. The Serbian coolly converted his eighth goal of the season on 91 minutes after being put through by Ryan Sessegnon. But despite Ranieri's anger, there seemed to be few hard feelings between the two players at the final whistle, as the relegation-threatened side celebrated their victory over the Premier League's bottom side. Mitrovic told BBC Sport: \"We had a small argument and I think it is my job for penalties. He did not think like this but I respect that. I have done the same in the past. \"I don't have a problem with this, he missed and that is part of football. He changed the game when he came on in the second half.\" Ranieri added: \"I said to Aboubakar Kamara to leave the ball to Aleksandar Mitrovic, he is the man who shoots the penalties. It is unbelievable what he did. \"I wanted to kill him. That is normal when one man takes a ball, only because he scored the last penalty (against Manchester United). It should be Mitrovic, that is it.\" Mitrovic said he felt like crying after missing several chances in his side's 1-1 draw at Wolves on Wednesday, but he proved to be the match-winner three days later. Fulham are now unbeaten in their last three games, keeping two clean sheets and though they remain in the drop zone, victory over Huddersfield lifted them up a place to 18th, just one point adrift of safety. A pleased Mitrovic on this occasion said: \"Last time I said I am so unhappy I want to cry, today I want to say I am so happy I want to cry. \"It is a big three points, we kept another clean sheet and that is a big improvement for us.  \"Today was a six-point game against rivals at the bottom and it was a very important game. It gives us confidence before facing Arsenal. We need to carry on winning games and taking points.\" Ranieri added: \"It was unbelievable. If we had to dream this match, it is important to score in the last minute and that is what we did.

One man. One legend. One throw-in. Iran were 1-0 down against Spain in injury time and had a throw-in - one final chance at claiming a famous draw. Milad Mohammadi kissed the ball, touched it off his forehead, looked to the sky and then did a forward roll before cancelling his plan to throw the ball at the final second. While the world looked on, baffled, he composed himself and took an orthodox short throw-in. Spain won the game. But given that it came in at number 11 in the rankings, maybe we should have stuck to a top 10 after all. Club managerial appointments can often go under the radar during the World Cup. Julen Lopetegui may well wish that had been the case with him. Spain went one better than the Republic of Ireland's effort of sending their captain home on the eve of the 2002 World Cup when they sent their manager home the day before the opening game. La Roja came into the tournament as one of the favourites, having gone 20 games unbeaten under Lopetegui - but just two days before the tournament started, Real Madrid announced he would be taking over as their boss after the tournament. Spain were so furious they let him start that job early by sacking him, with sporting director Fernando Hierro taking over for their ill-fated World Cup campaign - they were knocked out of in the last 16 by hosts Russia. Luckily it worked out well for Lopetegui at Real... Goalkeepers, you have one job. Stand in the goal and try to stop the ball. But as Son Heung-min was dumping Germany out of the World Cup, Manuel Neuer was 80 yards away. The world champions needed to win but two minutes into injury time were trailing to Kim Young-gwon's goal, which had been awarded by the video assistant referee. With nothing to lose, and Germany needing to score twice, Neuer, who manager Joachim Low once said was good enough to play in midfield, took that commendation literally. He came forward in open play for about a minute before losing the ball to Ju Se-jong, who aimed a long punt down to Son. Neuer knew the game was up and just stood watching instead of chasing back to his goal. Anyone know if there's a German word for the pleasure derived by someone from another person's misfortune? \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Tuesday, 18 December was a strange day. The whole world (bar a handful of people at most) woke up having no idea Jose Mourinho was about to be sacked as Manchester United boss. And we all went to bed knowing that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was going to be the next caretaker/interim/loanee manager. In a rarity for modern football, Mourinho's dismissal had not been broken in the media before the official announcement, which came after a limp 3-1 defeat by Liverpool on the Sunday. Molde boss Solskjaer then became Manchester United's first loan signing from Scandinavia since Helsingborg striker Henrik Larsson. The former United striker is set to go back to his club at the end of the season... unless the Old Trafford bosses decide to appoint him permanently. His appointment was not officially confirmed by United until the next day, although the Norwegian prime minister inadvertently broke the news on Tuesday night. Like we said, it was a strange day. The crowd at the Stadio Olimpico erupted at the final whistle as the Roma substitutes and coaching staff piled on to the pitch to celebrate with the players. There were tears in the stands as fans could not believe what they had seen - a sensational comeback to dump Barcelona out of the Champions League. A year after Barca became the second team in Champions League history to overturn a first-leg deficit of three goals or more (against Paris St-Germain), Roma became the third. Trailing 4-1 from the first leg against the unbeaten La Liga leaders, nobody gave Roma any chance. But goals from Edin Dzeko and Daniele de Rossi gave the Italians hope - before Kostas Manolas' goal with eight minutes remaining. They went on to lose to Liverpool in the semi-finals, but it will remain one of the great comebacks. Manchester City players celebrated with the fans like it was Agueroooooo all over again. Pep Guardiola leapt into the air on the touchline like Sir Alex Ferguson celebrating Steve Bruce's title-winning goal in 1993. Yet they had wrapped up the league a month earlier. Gabriel Jesus' chip in the last minute against Southampton on the final day made City the first team to reach 100 Premier League points. It was their 106th league goal of the season, another record. A positive goal difference of 79 was also a record. City won 32 of their 38 games, another record - this one for most victories in any English top-flight season. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         It was the moment everybody had seen coming for five years but never actually expected to arrive. Roughly a quarter of the population of the UK had never lived in a world without Arsene Wenger as Arsenal boss. More than five million people had been born in the UK since the Gunners last won a Premier League title. The Frenchman finally announced on 20 April that he would be leaving the north Londoners at the end of the season, a year before the end of his deal. He had a seven-game farewell tour - including a last defeat at Old Trafford and a final European exit - but it all ended with a 1-0 victory at Huddersfield on the last day of the campaign. As good as Gareth Bale's bicycle kick in the Champions League final was (see below), it didn't get him a \u00a399m move to Juventus. But Cristiano Ronaldo's did. Ronaldo flew into the Turin sky to send a stunning overhead kick flying past Gianluigi Buffon. It was arguably the greatest goal the Champions League has ever seen - and received a standing ovation from the Juve fans. Four months later he was theirs and the Portugal forward admitted the round of applause was a factor in his decision to join the Italian champions. Cue every opposition fan in England applauding Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne or Spurs' Harry Kane every time they score. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         First teenager since Pele to score twice in a World Cup game. First teenager since Pele to score in a World Cup final. Won the trophy that has eluded Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Kylian Mbappe shone as France won the World Cup, scoring a sparkling double against Argentina and a strike from outside the box against Croatia. He was clearly nowhere near an unknown, having already cost Paris St-Germain \u00a3165.7m, but it was the summer that Mbappe really showcased himself on the world stage as the man most likely to replace Messi and Ronaldo as the best. The now 20-year-old has carried that form into this season, with 13 league goals in 11 games. Only Lionel Messi has scored more in Europe's top five leagues. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Enough talking points to fill a decade of Champions League finals - squeezed into 90 remarkable minutes. Mohamed Salah's season had been leading up to this moment, but Sergio Ramos had other ideas when he pulled the Egyptian's arm and injured his shoulder midway through the first half. Salah left the field in tears as Ramos became public enemy number one in Liverpool (well the red half) and Egypt. The final will also be remembered for one of the biggest errors and one of the greatest moments of skill that European club football's showpiece game has ever seen. Goalkeeper Loris Karius' career at the club effectively ended when he threw the ball directly at Karim Benzema to hand Real the opening goal.  Welsh winger Bale's relationship with Real has been rocky at times but he etched himself into folklore with his fourth touch of the game. After coming off the bench, he sent an absolutely sensational bicycle kick flying past Karius from Marcelo's deflected shot. The fact that Karius spilling Bale's 30-yard strike into his own net to make it 3-1 was neither the German's biggest error nor the Welshman's best goal of the game tells its own story. But while the game was undoubtedly a classic, there was an even more memorable one to come just a few weeks later... Beer. Everywhere. Tears. Everywhere. A moment some England fans thought they would go to the grave without experiencing - a penalty shootout win at a World Cup. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         It was a gloriously sunny summer in which, for a brief period at least, football seemed to be coming home. England reaching the World Cup semi-finals was a shock to many, but the most surprising bit was the Three Lions actually winning a real-life penalty shootout. Gareth Southgate's side looked set for more woe when Jordan Henderson's kick was saved, but keeper Jordan Pickford and Eric Dier were the heroes as England beat Colombia. If history is anything to go by - with their only previous shootout success coming in Euro 96 against Spain - their next penalty win will be at Euro 2040. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        ", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46648194", "content": "As 2018 comes to an end, everyone will reflect on an eventful year during which England won a World Cup penalty shootout, Liverpool lost one of the most incident-packed Champions League finals ever, and Manchester City won the title in record-breaking style. But what do we have to look forward to in 2019? Manchester City's sky-blue ribbons were already being tied to the Premier League trophy this time last year as Pep Guardiola's side established a 14-point lead after only 18 games. The race to the tape was a formality. Not this year. This is shaping up as the most exciting season in years as Liverpool match, and indeed lead, City while Spurs and Chelsea, albeit in a more understated manner, make claims of their own. The excitement and anticipation surrounding this season can be illustrated in managers, players and supporters already weighing up the potential long-term damage of dropped points well before the turn of the year. The season is made even more exciting by the thrilling brand of football on offer from the teams chasing the big prize - from Guardiola's City to Jurgen Klopp's vibrant, attacking Liverpool side. Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino and newcomer Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea are also determined to pursue trophies in the most attractive manner, while the animated Unai Emery has been a breath of fresh air at Arsenal. And while life on the field has been dull at Manchester United, a familiar acrimonious decline into another pre-Christmas dismissal for Jose Mourinho has given Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the chance to illuminate the 'Theatre Of Dreams' once more. The Premier League has seen dramatic finishes in recent seasons, such as when Manchester City pipped Manchester United on goal difference in 2011-12, and when Liverpool stumbled at the finishing line to lose out to City two years later. This season could be just as dramatic. City won the title by 19 points from Manchester United last season and had a goal difference 33 ahead of their closest rivals in that department - Liverpool. It was a procession - but this could go to the wire. City's surprise defeat at home to Crystal Palace just before Christmas - after Liverpool had beaten Wolves the day before - means Guardiola's men are in the unusual position of playing catch-up, with four points separating the top two. One of the most vital acts in the drama will be played out when City and Liverpool face each other at Etihad Stadium on 3 January. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The ever-expanding global women's game gets its greatest showcase once more in France next summer - and expectations have never been higher as its profile continues to rise. The draw has only added to the anticipation as England, managed by Phil Neville, face Scotland, guided by head coach Shelley Kerr, in their opening game in Nice on 9 June. Argentina and Japan make up England and Scotland's group. The Lionesses are making their fifth World Cup appearance and will be hoping to improve on their 2015 performance, when they lost 2-1 to Japan in the semi-final. England are fourth in the world rankings behind the United States, Germany and France, with Scotland 20th. And the SheBelieves Cup, in which England will face Brazil, the United States and Japan in late February and early March, will provide an intriguing measure of their progress under Neville. The final of the Women's World Cup will be staged in the Stade de Lyon on 7 July. Celtic have been conducting a procession to the Scottish Premiership title for the past seven seasons - but it is all looking a lot tighter north of the border this season to set up a potentially thrilling 2019. A combination of ingredients are in the mix to make this a potent cocktail and allow Scotland to throw back some insults at the English about one-sided title races - especially after Manchester City's stroll to the title last term. The gap is no longer wider than the Clyde estuary. Steven Gerrard's arrival at Rangers was always going to add spice and it has not only raised sunken hopes at Ibrox but also coincided with a perhaps inevitable dip in the standards of a Celtic side that has carried all before them in manager Brendan Rodgers' first two seasons. It would, however, be patronising to simply focus on the Old Firm. Scottish football is offering much more. Celtic, Rangers, Hearts and Kilmarnock have all been top of the table this season - with Steve Clarke's work at Killie an outstanding piece of management. Aberdeen and Hibernian have also produced evidence of the ability to challenge and overcome the supposed natural order, and the first Ibrox meeting between Gerrard and his former Liverpool manager on 29 December is heavily loaded with significance. It is shaping up to be a 2019 to relish in Scotland. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         England capitalised on reaching their first World Cup semi-final for 28 years by reaching the finals of the inaugural Uefa Nations League with their first win in Spain for 31 years, and by exacting revenge on Croatia with a dramatic late 2-1 win at Wembley. It built on the feel-good factor engendered in Russia, maintained momentum and increased the belief manager Gareth Southgate has a squad offering real optimism for the future. Now they have a great chance to turn potential into something tangible in Portugal next June. England face Ronald Koeman's rejuvenated Netherlands in the semi-final, and Portugal play Switzerland in the other last-four game. No-one should kid themselves winning this would end the so-called \"years of hurt\" since the 1966 World Cup, as this tournament - which has been a surprise success and added a new dimension to the international scene - is very much in its infancy and way behind the majors like the World Cup and the Euros. But success breeds success and it would be a sign of England's progress and development under Southgate should they be able to win silverware as they re-establish themselves as a serious power in the game. England's Under-21s will also be hoping to add to the success of the under-17s and under-20s World Cup winners when they take part in the Euros in Italy and San Marino in June. This is another tournament that is growing in stature each time, and Aidy Boothroyd's side will have high hopes with talent such as Manchester City's Phil Foden, Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho, and Mason Mount - the Chelsea youngster on loan at Derby County - to potentially call on. They will face France, Romania and Croatia in their group games and, like England's seniors, will hope to improve on a bitter semi-final disappointment after losing on penalties to Germany in Tychy, Poland. This is an exciting time for England at all levels, and 2019 might just provide further evidence of how bright the future might be. Is there any division more difficult to get out of than the Championship? Some of England's greatest clubs have dropped out of the Premier League then found the return journey so competitive it proves impossible. If proof is needed, just look at those jockeying for position at the top of the table. Leeds United, under the guidance of the maverick but wonderfully innovative Marcelo Bielsa, have played some stunning football as they attempt to reclaim the place at the top table which has not been theirs since 2004, while Norwich City have been outstanding under Daniel Farke. And that is just the start. West Bromwich Albion have set their sights on instant promotion under Darren Moore while Derby County are making strides as Frank Lampard settles into his first managerial job. Chris Wilder is proving once more what an outstanding operator he is at his beloved Sheffield United while Middlesbrough's Tony Pulis - not everyone's cup of tea - has successfully navigated the Championship's course and distance before. And are things stirring at Aston Villa now boyhood fan Dean Smith has succeeded Steve Bruce? This is the division that produces tension and excitement every year because the price of success is so great and the price of failure can be so expensive. Expect no different in 2019.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46696457", "content": "Liverpool hold a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League after putting four past Newcastle at Anfield, while Tottenham scored five against Bournemouth at Wembley to move up to second. Reigning champions Manchester City suffered their second successive defeat, losing 2-1 at Leicester, Eden Hazard's two goals helped Chelsea beat Watford by the same scoreline, but Arsenal dropped two points as they could only draw 1-1 at Brighton. Manchester United made it two wins out of two under caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a 3-1 victory over Huddersfield and Everton bounced back from their thrashing against Tottenham on Sunday with a 5-1 win at Burnley, with the games involving Fulham and Wolves and Crystal Palace and Cardiff both ending in draws. The only match played on Thursday saw West Ham come from behind to win 2-1 at Southampton. When Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is firing on all cylinders you need your goalkeeper to be in top form. Fortunately for the Seagulls, Ryan was in great shape. Aubameyang could have scored a hat-trick but the Brighton keeper made three world-class saves from the Arsenal striker and Brighton owe their point to Ryan.   Did you know? Ryan made three important saves in Brighton's 1-1 draw against Arsenal, stopping the Gunners scoring in the second half for the first time in their last 17 Premier League games. Conor Coady: Fulham's game against Wolves was one they had to win to convince anyone their time in the Premier League was anything but temporary - and they failed. One of the reasons the Cottagers struggled was the commanding performance of centre-back Coady. The Wolves captain helped them seal a well-earned point when he brilliantly cleared a certain goal off the line. Meanwhile, starting with Ryan Sessegnon on the bench was an extraordinary decision bearing in mind he is one of the few players capable of scoring goals in a Fulham team that desperately needs them.    Did you know? Coady made a match-saving block in the 90th minute for Wolves to stop Mitrovic scoring and keep it at 1-1. Dejan Lovren: You had better take a picture of this! You won't see Dejan Lovren in my Team of the Week that often when he's got Virgil van Dijk, Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold in the line-up with him. But when you strike a half-volley as well as Lovren did against Newcastle, I think exceptions have to be made.  Did you know? As well as scoring the opener for Liverpool, Lovren helped the Reds keep a clean sheet, with no team-mate making more clearances (three). Yerry Mina: Everton badly needed this win against Burnley, especially after Spurs chewed the Toffees to bits at Goodison last Sunday, and Mina started the Everton goal-rush with a powerful header past Joe Hart. The Colombia defender is making a name for himself as a bit of a bruiser in defence and by the looks of things he is pretty menacing in attack as well. Did you know? Mina's opener (one minute 39 seconds) was the quickest Premier League goal by an Everton player since Tom Davies scored against Leicester after 30 seconds in April 2017. Ricardo Pereira: Well, who would have thought it? Manchester City went to Leicester in desperate need of points and came back empty-handed. Now the champions find themselves seven points behind Liverpool at the halfway stage of the season. It took a super goal from the Foxes' Pereira to do it. The Portugal international hit his shot so sweetly it screamed past City goalkeeper Ederson. I think it's 'all or nothing' now, Pep. Did you know? Pereira scored the winner against the reigning Premier League champions, also having more touches than any other Leicester player (69). Paul Pogba: Two well-taken goals against Huddersfield have laid down a marker. His dreadful hairstyles have also slowly disappeared as well. I really hope these are the signs of a much more mature player. With Jose Mourinho gone, Pogba is also starting to play with a freedom that was absent earlier in the season. Graeme Souness has given the best analysis of Pogba I have ever heard. Should Pogba happen to listen to the Liverpool and Scottish legend, he too could become a really great player. Did you know? Pogba has been directly involved in four goals in two Premier League games under Solskjaer (two goals, two assists), the same total he had registered in his last 12 games under Mourinho (one goal, three assists). Felipe Anderson: What a fabulous counter attack. West Ham absolutely ripped Southampton to shreds on the back of their own free-kick. Once the ball fell to Felipe Anderson that was it. The Brazilian is playing the most consistent football I think I've seen him play. His earlier strike put West Ham on level terms and with a little luck Anderson might have had a hat-trick. The Hammers are blowing bubbles at the moment and it is all down to Felipe Anderson. An outstanding performance.  Did you know? Felipe Anderson has scored seven times in his past nine West Ham appearances, after netting only once in his opening 12 games in all competitions for the club. Lucas Digne: This was a very impressive response by Everton having received a terrible mauling from Spurs only a few days ago. I don't think you will see two better strikes from a wing-back all season. Digne not only has a taste for goals, but he has also adapted brilliantly to the demands of Marco Silva's new-look line-up. Did you know? Five of the eight goals scored by Everton's Digne in Europe's big five leagues have come from outside the box, including each of his three for the Toffees. Son Heung-min: Eleven goals in two games? I must be dreaming. It was Martin Keown who said on Final Score two weeks ago that Spurs had the sort of fixtures in the next few weeks that could see them challenging for the title. I didn't believe him then but I'm beginning to change my mind now. Son is in fantastic form but now we lose him for three games because of the Asian Cup. Couldn't they host the Asian Cup in June? Did you know? Tottenham's Son has had a hand in 10 goals in his past nine Premier League appearances (seven goals, three assists). Mohamed Salah: This was a stroll in the park for Liverpool. Newcastle were out of their depth from the moment the game started. In fact, I doubt whether Salah's kit required washing after this game. Newcastle should also have known better than to place hands on Salah in the penalty area, especially at Anfield. Such incidents only result in spot-kicks and Salah normally obliges. Did you know? Salah has been involved in 36 goals in 28 home Premier League games for Liverpool (25 goals, 11 assists). Eden Hazard: This was a masterclass by Hazard against a Watford side that stood up to Chelsea. However, the Belgium international was the difference between the two teams. Hazard took both his goals as though he was playing in a training match. The coolness, not to mention the authority in Hazard's game at the moment, is quite frightening. Did you know? Chelsea playmaker Hazard has been directly involved in 19 goals in the Premier League this season (10 goals, nine assists); the most of any player. I have admired Carlo Ancelotti for many years and had the pleasure of interviewing him on a number of occasions during his successful period at Chelsea. He always struck me as a quiet, dignified man with a steel edge. However, what the discussions with the Italian did not expose was his moral compass. I'm not sure how I missed it but I never thought he would be one among very few managers (Louis van Gaal and Guus Hiddink are others) in the world who have threatened to take their entire team off the pitch because of racial abuse. What men.  The game between Inter Milan versus Napoli was not Italian football's finest 90 minutes. Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly was targeted at the San Siro, where the Senegal defender was sent off.  \"The next time we'll stop playing even if we lose the match,\" said the former Chelsea boss. Ancelotti has a point. After all when one player is offside isn't the entire team? Likewise when a black player is suffering a torrent of racial abuse isn't the team suffering too? Ancelotti is clearly not prepared to stand for it. And so he shouldn't.

Jose Mourinho was sacked as Manchester United manager on Tuesday after two and a half years in charge. During his career he has also coached at Benfica, Porto, Chelsea (twice), Inter Milan and Real Madrid but has never been at one club for more than four years at a time. Where will he end up next? BBC Radio 5 live's Euro Leagues panel of Steve Crossman, James Horncastle, Julien Laurens and Raphael Honigstein look at Mourinho's options and discuss why it went wrong for him at Old Trafford. A return to Inter Milan? Horncastle: \"Jose Mourinho is still a very big personality in Italy. At Inter Milan games there is still a banner that says 'Jose Mourinho' and there is a lot of speculation about what might be his next move. Inter always features very highly but this is a very different Inter to the one he left in 2010, a different owner, different president, different chief executive and it is something that is not as clear-cut as many people think. \"He is still popular with the fans but in terms of being a next destination if Luciano Spalletti were to get the sack, this is someone who got Inter back into the Champions League and recently signed a new contract so I think he will have to look elsewhere before a reunion, a la Chelsea.\" How about a new challenge in a new league at Paris St-Germain? Laurens: \"There's no talk of 'could he could come to PSG?'. It could've happened four or five years ago when Laurent Blanc was chosen but he is not the kind of manager they would go for anymore.\" Horncastle: \"There was a time when PSG would've considered him and he felt it was not the right time for him, and that time seems to have gone.\" If not France, what about Germany? Honigstein: \"Bayern Munich looked at Jose when he was in between Chelsea and Inter (2007-08) and there were some preliminary discussions. But they have never wanted someone who was too overbearing and wanted someone who could work in the existing structure and they chose Jurgen Klinsmann just ahead of Jurgen Klopp. \"There's no vibe or scenario at the moment (for a move to Germany). Bayern are the one club that could offer enough for him but the sense in Munich is that he does not offer enough for them. \"It is no longer the case where you think of him as a specialist in European football as his record over the past five of six years has been pretty average. It reflects his loss of stature that he is not being mentioned, compared to someone like Zinedine Zidane on the back of winning three European Cups.\" What about another spell at Real Madrid? Horncastle: \"Let's watch the Club World Cup. Real Madrid, if they were not to win, imagine the fall-out. Mourinho has a good relationship with [Real president] Florentino Perez and a job has to be done to clear out the old guard - what better person than Jose. That remains a possibility.\" Any chance of a wildcard move? To a team in Russia, China or perhaps international football? Horncastle: \"I think he has to be under the spotlight and in the big games, so he needs to be in one of the top five leagues.\" Laurens: \"His own image is far too important to him for him to go to China or Russia. He needs the spotlight and, personally, I think his next move is to be Portugal's next international team manager. Fernando Santos is 64 years old. You have a young generation coming through for Portugal, it would not scare him that challenge.\" Portugal boss? So potentially working with Cristiano Ronaldo again? Honigstein: \"I don't think the relationship is so bad between them, as has been reported, but Ronaldo repeatedly went on record and said he did not enjoying playing that way at Real Madrid - he didn't see why they should play without the ball.\" Laurens: \"I don't think Ronaldo would never play for Jose Mourinho again but it's not a happy reunion of those guys as there's not that positivity between them at all.\" Horncastle: \"One of the reasons the decision has been taken by Manchester United is that players were considering their futures. \"Juventus and other clubs around Europe were looking at this situation and the longer it went on the better it was for them because of the deterioration in relationship between Mourinho and the best players. The headline in La Repubblica the day after the sacking was 'Pogba has won'. In La Gazzetta dello Sport it was 'Pogba is now laughing'. Laurens: \"It got to the point where very promising players were ruling out Manchester United as they were saying 'I don't want to be the next Anthony Martial or Paul Pogba, being marginalised, not playing, and having my progress impeded.' \"I've talked to a couple of agents with interesting players and the dynamic has now changed. No longer is there that sense of Manchester United being a barren land where you would not dream of sending your best player there.\" Laurens: \"If you own or are the chairman of a big European club would you really want Jose Mourinho, knowing that after one or three years that things will get bad, as they always do?  \"He will sign something and say he wants to stay 10 years and it never works out. Why would you put that investment in him knowing at some point it will get toxic? I don't know who would take that gamble and hiring Mourinho right now is a gamble. \"You are not sure of trophies and in regards of how much they spend and the damage he has done to that club in two and a half years - it has not been a good return. The style of football, you know will not be good and the relationship with key players will deteriorate so badly that you will have to sack him.\"  Horncastle: \"If you're Real and planning a transition and want to bring in Neymar, are they going to buy into that when they have seen what has happened at United?\" Laurens: \"If Real Madrid wanted to sign Eden Hazard and Mourinho is the manager I will guarantee that Hazard would not go to Real. The other thing Mourinho has not realised is now clubs have to look at the bottom line - if you are someone that can buy a \u00a35m player and he is suddenly worth \u00a345m six months down the line, that's why Mauricio Pochettino is in demand. \"Mourinho has never been interested in that. He is very harsh and unforgiving and I don't think that's the right model anymore. You cannot afford one of your biggest players to not be playing or developing.\" \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Honigstein: \"When you go to Real Madrid and Manchester United and try to play underdog football it does not work. It is no longer a strategy to sit deep and hope for teams to be broken down. You can't afford to sit back and wait for things to happen. Even the smaller teams will now have enough quality to beat you.\" Horncastle: \"When he went to Inter he made a big deal about his 'bible', his methodology where he looked around trends around Europe and adapted his methods, but I don't think that has happened for a while. There are other peers like Jurgen Klopp who has a system where you play in a modern style of football.\" Laurens: \"It was a mess and he tried so many things at United. Against Tottenham in the first half they pressed so high and were unlucky to not be two or three up and it looked like he was ready to change, although they lost the game (3-0 after it was goalless at half-time).

On Wednesday, the 2018-19 Big Bash League gets under way, with 59 matches taking place before the champions are crowned on 17 February. You can hear selected matches on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, beginning with the first game between Brisbane Heat and defending champions Adelaide Strikers at 08:05 GMT. Former England batsman Ian Bell, a BBL winner with Perth Scorchers in 2017, will be part of the commentary team for the opener, with ex-England pace bowler Graham Onions and Women's World Cup winners Tammy Beaumont, Lydia Greenway and Ebony Rainford-Brent among those who will be appearing across the tournament. Here are just a few of the reasons why you should be following a staple of the Australian summer... If you're not yet familiar with the work of Jofra Archer, you probably soon will be. The Sussex fast bowler has slowly been making a name for himself in T20 leagues around the world - to the extent that he may be better known overseas than he is in the UK.  He took last year's Big Bash by storm thanks to his charisma, searing pace and the type of athleticism that allows him to do outrageous things in the field. A change in eligibility rules means that the Barbados-born 23-year-old will be eligible to play for England at some point during the spring. National selector Ed Smith has not ruled out parachuting him straight into the squad for the World Cup. By the summer, he could be a big, big star. Get to know him now. It was '90s Britpop heroes Pulp who taught us \"things go better with a little razzmatazz\" (if you're under the age of 25, ask your parents). The BBL sweetly mixes the actual cricket with entertainment, glitzing things up with pyro, frenzied fans and the occasional celebrity - Will Smith showed up to a game last year. Not only that, but there is a certain romance in allowing yourself to be whisked away to a balmy Australian night when cricket is being played under the stars. As you warm yourself by the fire under the glow of the Christmas lights, be transported to the sunshine on the other side of the world. If you're a little rusty on your knowledge of Australian backyard cricket, allow us to fill you in. It is customary for a bat, rather than a coin, to be flipped in gardens across Australia in order to decide who has the choice of batting or bowling first. Now, the bat-flip is coming to the BBL. Instead of 'heads' or 'tails', captains will call 'hills' or 'flats' as a specially weighted bat rotates into the sky. You're intrigued, aren't you? No serving England Test captain has ever taken part in an overseas T20 league. And while it is becoming the norm for us to see England players play their trade across the globe, Joe Root's move to the Sydney Thunder comes with a little extra mustard. Root has been very clear in his desire to play all three formats for England, yet, thanks to a combination of regular resting and others overtaking him, he has lost his place in the T20 side. His other international commitments mean he has little chance to play domestic T20 matches for Yorkshire and he has opted against a place in this year's IPL auction. The Big Bash represents Root's best opportunity to both hone his shortest-form skills and prove he is worthy of a place in the England team. Remember, there is a T20 World Cup in Australia in 2020. He'll be lining up for the Thunder with his great mate and white-ball megastar Jos Buttler. Just imagine those two batting together at the SCG. The sandpaper scandal claimed a number of high-profile casualties, throwing shade on to the man who actually tampered with the ball then tried to conceal the evidence in his undies. Opening batsman Cameron Bancroft's nine-month ban was three months lighter than the suspension dished out to Steve Smith and David Warner.  He will be eligible to play for Perth Scorchers from 29 December, with a trip to Hobart Hurricanes scheduled for the following day. What sort of reaction will he receive from the Australian public? Away games against Sydney Thunder on 2 January and Melbourne Stars on 9 January look particularly tasty. Then again, in an Ashes year, could it be the beginning of Bancroft's return to the Australia team? It's not just Root, Buttler and Archer who will be gracing the BBL. Whereas once you'd only find Kevin Pietersen banging the drum for English players to dip their toes into franchise waters, now there is English interest at pretty much every turn. Tymal Mills joins Archer in an all-Sussex pace attack at Hobart Hurricanes, Liam Plunkett will line up for Melbourne Stars and David Willey will feature for three-time champions Perth Scorchers. On top of that, Chris Jordan is also in the Thunder squad, Joe Denly and Tom Curran will join forces at Sydney Sixers, and Harry Gurney has been snapped up by Melbourne Renegades.

Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said a no-deal exit would threaten access to EU-wide criminal databases and make it harder to extradite people from abroad. She told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed. Parliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it. The prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc. After Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects. The agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.  Please upgrade your browser The priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome. Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit. While she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\". \"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can. \"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\" A no deal Brexit could \"put the public at risk\" because of reduced security collaboration with the EU, says Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick #r4today https://t.co/v9XVVpWbcm pic.twitter.com/mABJ3J6ojW End of Twitter post  by @BBCr4today The Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit. She also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary. \"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.  \"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\" Ms Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU. But campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.  The organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.  \"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.  The Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.  \"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this. In the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers. She said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".  The authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working out what had happened and there would have to be much closer working between the private sector and the military to ensure there was no repeat.

Southampton responded to David Silva's early opener when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg took the ball off Oleksandr Zinchenko and fired it into the top corner. City had luck on their side when Raheem Sterling's shot deflected off James Ward-Prowse to make it 2-1. Sergio Aguero's back-post header completed the scoring before half-time. Southampton goalscorer Hojbjerg - who had only just returned from suspension - was shown a straight red card for a lunging tackle on Fernandinho with just over five minutes to go. City had a number of decent chances as Silva, Aguero and Riyad Mahrez all went close in the first half and Aguero smacked the crossbar after the break. Southampton threatened too and Charlie Austin was twice denied by City keeper Ederson in the first half before Hojbjerg's equaliser. But the Saints were ultimately undone by Pep Guardiola's free-flowing side, who move up to second place in the table. Liverpool went 10 points clear of City at the top of the table with a devastating 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal on Saturday, meaning the defending champions needed victory to keep pace in the title race. City appeared to feel the pressure on Boxing Day when they squandered an early lead and allowed Leicester to win 2-1 at the King Power Stadium.  But they stood up to the challenge at St Mary's - peppering Southampton's goal from the off and responding to the equaliser with two quick goals on the stroke of half-time. City's opening goal was straight from Guardiola's textbook: Bernardo Silva's neat build-up down the right and cut-back into the centre was comfortably put away by an unmarked David Silva. Sterling's shot was then deflected by Ward-Prowse and flapped into the net by Alex McCarthy to make it 2-1 before Aguero headed in Zinchenko's cross at the back post with ease.  It means City can cut Liverpool's lead to four points when the two teams meet at the Etihad Stadium on 3 January. The last time Southampton played City in early November they were hammered 6-1 and failed to respond to three early goals. But this time Southampton posed a threat and came close to breaking down a slightly nervy City defence on occasions. Austin's header at the near post was well saved by Ederson in the first half and that came moments after the keeper had avoided Hojbjerg's sliding tackle on the goal-line.  And Saints' pressing paid off when Hojbjerg robbed Zinchenko of the ball in the build-up to his equaliser. City could not extend their lead in the second half but Southampton's good work was only undone by the late sending-off of Hojbjerg. A trip to Stamford Bridge is a difficult start to the new year but the Saints will likely avoid the drop if they can produce performances like this in the second half of the season.  \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"The first 15-20 minutes we were not very good but we smelt a bit of sensation when we equalised. We saw that Man City is not that confident in the moment like they are when they win week after week. We tried to push ourselves back into the game and press a little bit earlier but we saw when they have time to turn they are dangerous. \"At half time we thought about preparing the guys for a good second half but in the mind was also the next game against Chelsea. And then the worst thing happened in the red card for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg which is disappointing because he is one of the most important players in our team.  \"In a game which is 3-1 and with only five minutes to go, you have to ask the use of such a tackle.

Defending champions City, who beat Southampton 3-1 on Sunday, go into Thursday's home game against Liverpool seven points adrift of the Reds. \"The problem is the other team is fantastic,\" Guardiola told BBC Sport. \"[Liverpool are] maybe the best team in Europe or the world right now and in top form.\" While City have suffered defeats against Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Leicester in December, Liverpool have won all seven league games they have played. They ended 2018 in style, beating Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield to briefly go 10 points clear of City. Speaking about Liverpool's ability, Guardiola added: \"You have to accept it. All we can do is do our job, play our games and after that we will see.\" In addition to their dominant position in the league, Liverpool have a recent edge over City because they knocked the Blues out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals last season. If the Reds were to win on Thursday, they would restore their 10-point cushion and become heavy favourites to win a first league title since 1990. City captain Vincent Kompany said the game against the league leaders is the type of match \"you live for\". \"Our pride has been hurt over recent weeks but we have everything to play for. It depends on us,\" Kompany told Sky Sports. \"Every living soul that comes into the stadium has to be ready to fight and give it to them [Liverpool], and we should be able to pull everything out of the locker for that game.\"", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46007194", "content": "\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Manchester City cruised to victory over a sorry Southampton side to return to the top of the Premier League. City took just six minutes to open the scoring as Wesley Hoedt smashed an attempted clearance of Leroy Sane's cross into his own net, before Sergio Aguero doubled their lead by tapping in Raheem Sterling's cross. David Silva slammed home their third from Sane's flick-on after 18 minutes but Danny Ings did pull one back from the spot after Ederson brought him down in the area. Sterling then netted either side of the break to complete an impressive personal performance, while Sane added a late sixth to cap off a fine afternoon for Pep Guardiola's men. Both of the England forward's goals were assisted by Aguero, as the Argentine first crossed for Sterling to stroke in, before a slide-rule pass enabled the 23-year-old to finish emphatically. Sane's goal came deep into injury time, firing past Alex McCarthy following a lightning counter-attack with Southampton legs tiring. Guardiola's side have now won eight of their past nine matches across all competitions, although Ings' penalty was the first league goal they have conceded in six games. Liverpool had moved above City after their draw with Arsenal on Saturday evening but the Reds held on to top spot for less than 24 hours. Meanwhile, Saints are now seven Premier League games without a victory and lie 16th. City's thumping win marked the 12th time that Guardiola's side have scored five or more goals in a single Premier League game since the Spaniard arrived at the club - no other team has done so on more than six occasions in the same timeframe. And they threatened from the off, as Southampton had already been warned of their hosts' attacking quality several times, before Hoedt's attempted clearance ended up in his own net. Aguero had already spurned one good chance before he turned in Sterling's cross for his 150th Premier League goal, after the England forward and Bernardo Silva linked up classily.  David Silva then added his side's third in the 18th minute, his powerful volley from Sane's flick-on leaving McCarthy helpless, but before then the Blues had seen a number of dangerous attacks break down. The home side eased off after this early blitz, which saw them enjoy 81% of the possession in the opening 20 minutes, with a fifth straight league win over Southampton already in the bag. Ings' penalty seemed to reignite the hosts' appetite for goals, as City began to push again, in large through the excellent Sterling. And it was the ex-Liverpool winger who netted their fourth, stroking in at the second attempt, after initially miss-controlling Aguero's pass. After being heavily involved in all three of their opening goals, Sterling's effort was richly deserved. The England man was lively throughout, and although he could have done better with several half-chances, he illustrated his clinical side by powering in his 50th goal for the club on 67 minutes. Having earlier set up Aguero's tap-in, Sterling again turned provider late on, as it was from his pass that Sane netted City's sixth. The German's strike took his club's goal tally to 33 after the opening 11 Premier League games, meaning they are well on their way to matching last season's record-breaking tally of 106, although they had already netted 38 by this stage in 2017-18. Few would have given Saints much of a chance coming into this match, given the fact they were winless in their last eight visits to the Etihad prior to Sunday, and that proved to be the case. Guardiola's side were ruthless, punishing nearly every goalscoring opportunity in the opening stages. And although Ings' fifth goal of the season did provide them with a potential way back into the game, they never looked like producing any sort of comeback. Chances were few and far between for Mark Hughes' side, although Ings did draw a good save from Ederson after the Brazilian had fumbled a powerful James Ward-Prowse strike. And City's goalkeeper also had to be alert shortly after, getting down low to keep out Ings' near-post header. But they failed to mount a sustained period of pressure, and it was the home side that looked more likely to score throughout the second half, as the Saints' search for a second Premier League victory of the season goes on. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I thought it was a great team performance, not just with the ball.

It is great times at the moment.\" Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We played excellently, without and especially with the ball. We were aggressive in the final third, but we were lucky to score the goal in the last minute of the first half. The game was not over, because we concede. Southampton created more chances than most teams this season.\" Southampton boss Mark Hughes, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We were poor in that opening period, you have to be resolute to keep back an outstanding City team.

But then again, no ordinary athlete would run 655 and a half laps around a track for 24 hours. Nor would they break two world records in doing so. Herron ran 162.9 miles in 24 hours and completed the first 100 miles in 13 hours and 25 minutes at December's Desert Solstice in Arizona, both new women's records on the track. She ran five miles further than the man who finished in second place. Herron's levels of endurance seem to have no bounds, yet for the average runner, even less than a quarter of the distance she covered would leave them in agony. But Herron doesn't seem to feel pain.  \"I had seven stress fractures when I was a young athlete but I didn't know my bones were broken,\" she says. \"I didn't think the pain was that bad.\" Here, Herron - who celebrates her 37th birthday on Christmas Day - tells BBC Sport about her comparisons with fictional ballet dancer Billy Elliot, smiling through sleep deprivation and getting her sport to the Olympic Games. Fourteen years ago, Herron, who lives in Oklahoma, was a recreational runner who covered 70 miles a week. Her now-husband, Conor, was the serious athlete in the relationship yet on their first run together, she was able to go much further. With his encouragement, her running career took off and she went on to win 21 marathons. But there was still energy in the tank and a new challenge was needed. \"It was a pretty scary thing to go from a marathon to running 100km, which is more than twice the distance,\" she says. \"I just had to take a leap of faith and believe that I could do it. I joked that it was like Billy Elliot doing ballet for the first time, it was this amazing feeling of 'I think I'm meant to do this'. It just felt incredible. \"I found my calling in life after taking this leap of faith and I believed that I could do it.\" After underperforming at two shorter runs, she completed her first 100km race in 2015, and in doing so, broke a record held by Ann Trason, who is considered \"the greatest ultrarunner of all time\". \"That was the impetus that told me maybe I should continue doing this,\" she says. Herron now does between four and six ultras a year but 2018 was the year she decided to push her body harder than ever before. The Desert Solstice Invitational sees 30 runners choose one of, or both, a 100 mile or 24 hour race completed simultaneously on a 400m track at a Phoenix high school. From the moment she broke Trason's 100km record, Herron had her target set on smashing world records and this meet, held on 8-9 December, was her chance to do so. \"It was the furthest I had gone and I had to wrap my head around the idea of going for 24 hours, having to run through the night and troubleshoot these things that you don't experience on the shorter distances,\" she says. \"You're pushing through a period when your body wants to go to sleep, so I was venturing into the unknown doing the 24 hour race, but at the same time, it was an exciting thing to do something I had never done before.\" Yet despite upping her race distances, Herron still trains like a marathon runner. Her longest training run prior to Desert Solstice was just 20.5 miles. \"The first couple of ultras that I did, I was trying to alter my training, trying to do longer training runs and cover more miles, but I found that it broke me down, made me really tired and made me underperform,\" she says. \"When I went back to the marathon structure, I felt better and that's when I started having all of my success. I obviously can't do 162 miles in training but it is amazing what your body can do on race day.\" Any long-distance runner knows the pain of hitting that invisible brick wall but when it hit Herron, she still had six more hours to run. She had watched the sun set but it was yet still to rise. Thankfully, she and her husband had a contingency plan in place. It involved a dash to her favourite fast food restaurant. \"We decided that if I got to a point like that, I would try to take in more sustenance,\" she says. \"They had actually gone to Taco Bell and got some double-decker tacos ready for me, and some beer. \"It felt like I was a zombie, like I was in a trance. This was my first time running the distance so I didn't really know what I was experiencing but I felt like my mind took over my legs.\" Coca Cola and ginger beer, as well as the expected water and sports drinks, were also on the menu during the race, which changed direction every four hours to reduce boredom among the runners. Well, not all the runners.  \"Surprisingly, it was not that monotonous,\" Herron says. \"We were surrounded by people and there was a lot of drama unfolding too, people were stopping and puking, going to the restroom. \"I'm a happy person, every picture of me from the race shows me smiling. I love to run.\" Having gone through three pairs of trainers and burned more than 10,000 calories, Herron had to be caught before she fell over from exhaustion when the 24 hours was up. She had to be wheeled around in a wheelchair yet she still had a smile on her face. She won the race by some distance. Second place went to Jacob Jackson, who ran 157.58 miles. \"It was the most exciting thing that I beat a highly competitive men's field. I'm over the moon that it actually happened,\" she says. \"It really became mind over body and it feels like the further you go, the more it became an equaliser in the possibility of women beating men. \"I feel like I am racing against myself but at the same time, the fact that I am against all these top men, it pushes me to raise the bar even higher.\" Next up for Herron is the 24 Hour World Championships but she has an even bigger target on her agenda - to make ultrarunning an Olympic sport.  \"I feel the Olympics is the next step for the sport to go more mainstream and for it to be more respected at the international level,\" she says. \"LA is hosting the 2028 Olympics and whoever hosts the Games gets to pick new events. If we could potentially get an event into those Games or maybe an exhibition event, I would love more people to be exposed to what we are doing because it is pretty incredible. \"I'm 36 now and at that point I will be 46, but women ultrarunners are going into their fifties, so I might be just at the beginning of my career!\"", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/46665179", "content": "One night, two cities, two arenas and two fights meant a huge night for British boxing on Saturday. In Manchester, Josh Warrington retained his IBF featherweight world title with a unanimous points win over Carl Frampton in a fight-of-the-year contender. And in London, heavyweight Dillian Whyte delivered a brutal 11th-round knockout of Dereck Chisora. So what next for Warrington and Frampton? And will Whyte get a rematch with world champion Anthony Joshua? After Whyte beat Chisora for a second time in two years, he called out Joshua for a rematch. Joshua, the IBF, WBA and WBO champion, said the 30-year-old was third on his list of targets, behind WBC title holder Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. He knocked out Whyte in the seventh round when the pair met in 2015 and has a date at Wembley Stadium booked for 13 April, but is yet to decide the opponent. Whyte has not lost since facing Joshua and is the number one WBC and WBO contender. This year he has knocked out Lucas Browne, beaten former WBO champion Joseph Parker on points, and knocked out Chisora. Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's boxing podcast, said Whyte deserved a title shot. \"Fury wants Wilder - if that is not the case then he will look at the other guys who could be a contender for 13 April,\" said Hearn. \"After their [Whyte and Joshua's] first fight and their history and everything Whyte has done this year he deserves his heavyweight world title shot. \"Whyte will be called as the WBO mandatory challenger in the early part of 2019. By September, Joshua is supposed to face him anyway. I believe he will get a shot; it just depends whether that will come on 13 April or not.\" Warrington stunned Lee Selby to win the IBF world featherweight title in May.  He backed up that victory against former two-weight world champion and favourite Frampton in his first title defence, which took his professional record to 28-0, with six knockouts. \"We played out a million different results,\" said BBC analyst Steve Bunce. \"I opted for a draw and controversy, there was no discussion ever of Warrington hurting Frampton.\" BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello added: \"In fairness, you look at his record going into the Frampton fight - 27 wins, six inside the distance. That statistic tells you he has power but it is not concussive or fight-changing power. Tonight it was.  \"He was shaking Frampton to his feet time and time again. It was an emphatic win for Warrington.\" Warrington said after the fight: \"I like the [underdog] title. It takes the pressure off.\" The 28-year-old looks set for a unification bout against one of the division's other belt holders: WBO champion Oscar Valdez, WBA champion Leo Santa Cruz or WBC champion Gary Russell Jr. \"The mad thing is, the moment it is announced - if it is Russell, or Valdez or Santa Cruz, they won't start just as favourites, they will start as prohibitive favourites,\" said Bunce. My initial reaction, looking at Carl Frampton's body language, is that he looks like a man absolutely in a hole \"This kid could beat all three of those on his day, I believe that. He could start as underdog in five of the biggest fights of his life, five world title fights. \"He might go the rest of his career as an underdog. He is not interested in, say, defending against British champion Ryan Walsh at home at Elland Road. He wants one of the big three.\" For Frampton, 31, the defeat is a blow to to his desire to meet Santa Cruz for a third time, having lost the belt to the Mexican in January 2017. Bunce added: \"No-one is talking about a rematch between Frampton and Warrington. My initial reaction, looking at Carl, pure body language, is that looks like a man who is absolutely in a hole.  \"One thing I will say is if you're going to come back, come back soon. Don't come back next November; get in the gym in January.\" Costello suggested Warrington's victory showed his skill as a fighter. He said: \"We have always seen Frampton as a man who fights with his head as much as his heart and [against Warrington] he got it the wrong way round. \"I think what we have seen from Warrington is a man who can adapt. It is something he hasn't been given a lot of credit for. After what he has done against Frampton and against Selby, two very different styles of fighters, he has found a way.\" \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         It was the clash of the pay-per-views on Saturday as Frank Warren and Hearn, British boxing's two biggest promoters, went head-to-head with their shows. The decision to stage both fights on the same night was criticised by some fans. We are doing 60 shows worldwide next year. We will be clashing with ourselves, let alone other promoters But Hearn, managing director of promotions company Matchroom Sport, said: \"The pleasing thing to come out of tonight, is whatever you bought, you were happy with - ultimately as a promoter and for the sport of boxing, that is what matters.  \"For people who spend their hard-earned money to come to the arena or watch it live on TV, you want them to love what they have seen and have value for money. It sounds like everyone got that. \"It's going to get worse, you have ITV, BT, Sky, Channel 5. We [Matchroom] are doing 60 shows worldwide next year. We will be clashing with ourselves, let alone other promoters.  \"Let's embrace what a great time it is for British boxing, rather than moan all the time.\"", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46630511", "content": "What's your favourite piece of football memorabilia? An autograph? Maybe a shirt worn by your favourite player?  How about the DNA of your club captain? That is exactly what Swedish champions AIK are offering this Christmas. For 3,499 Swedish krona (\u00a3307) fans can buy the crystallised DNA of club legend Nils-Eric Johansson, who was forced to retire in February because of a heart defect. The 38-year-old's genetic make-up comes in a test tube and lasts for 500 years. \"It's like Jurassic Park!\" Johansson tells BBC Sport. \"In 500 years, you might see a lot of Johanssons running around, who knows?\" Johansson says technically he could be cloned, but a section of the DNA is removed to prevent \"illicit or illegal behaviour\". \"It is not 100% me; it is 99%. That 1% is very important for my own sake and protects my copyright to the DNA,\" says the former Bayern Munich, Blackburn and Leicester defender. \"You would not be able to put my DNA on a crime scene for instance, as it would not match perfectly, so you could tell it wasn't me.\" He jokes: \"[If you cloned me] it would probably be right-footed instead of left-footed.\" Johansson was introduced to the company DNAMQ, which \"integrates identity into products\" and was founded by former AIK, Chelsea and Coventry goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and Dr Robert Grass. Former Sweden international Johansson went to the Swiss laboratory of Dr Grass, who took a swab from his mouth to be able to mass produce the DNA, which he says looks like \"snow or ice\". Former Motorhead drummer Mikkey Dee has undergone the process, although it is thought that Johansson is the first sportsman to sell his DNA. \"You can get a worn match shirt that will have DNA in it, but it will be washed out,\" Johansson says. \"This is a way to keep you crystallised for 500 years. \"You can bring your favourite player home with you, keep him and have them for a very long time. A lot of fans love to collect things - this could be one of those things. \"When I first got asked to do this, I was taken aback, I thought it was quite scary - has technology gone too far? \"But it is fun to push the boundaries, see if the fans like it, and the reaction has mostly been positive. \"My wife is OK with it. We have the ultimate DNA of our three kids running around at home.\" AIK have produced 371 boxes, one for each game Johansson played for the club, containing a test tube of DNA, a captain's armband with his face printed on it and a certificate of authenticity. Some of the proceeds will go to a charity in Sweden, and Johansson said it was \"hard to put a price tag on DNA and myself\". \"Each box represents one game I have played in. There a lot of stories in one box,\" he adds. Johansson won the Bundesliga with Bayern in 2001 and the League Cup with Blackburn in 2002, having joined for \u00a32.7m the previous year. After two seasons at Leicester, he joined AIK in 2007, but in February this year was told by doctors that he could not play again because of a long-standing heart issue. Johansson was born with the heart problem and has known about it since he was 20. However, aged 38, he was advised to retire two weeks before the season. AIK paid tribute to Johansson by adding a picture of his face and the words \"#4 - Our Captain\" to the sleeves of their shirts for the season. The team won the Allsvenskan in November and Johansson was invited to lift the trophy alongside captain Henok Goitom. \"It was a risk I was not willing to take. I am 38 and have got three kids. My career was almost done anyway,\" he said. \"But it was a lot to take. I had done pre-season and worked so hard to get in shape and compete with the youngsters, when the doctors said 'no more'. \"From then on I had to watch from the stands.\" He added: \"I am very lucky and happy they saw it. Had I continued, something might have happened and I could have died on the pitch. \"At the same time, I felt fit and thought 'why can't I play and do what I love?' It comes back to my family and making sure I am there for them. \"Sometimes I wake up and think I am going training.

Florsch, 18, fractured her spine after losing control of her car, which flew through the air before smashing into a fence and photographers' bunker. The German is hoping to become the first female Formula 1 world champion. \"It's quite a big goal but I'm getting closer every year,\" Florsch said. \"I'm feeling good. It all happened like four weeks ago and I can nearly do everything - the pain is getting less day by day,\" the German told BBC Sport. \"The last two weeks have been quite OK; I started with my rehab two weeks ago so you don't lose any more muscles at the beginning, and so my body keeps working again. \"For me now, it's just about finding the basics, to build up my strength and arms and legs, but I can do everything apart from using my back and my neck, so it's been an OK couple of weeks. My goal is to be back in the car at the end of February or the beginning of March \"I had two broken bones in my spinal column, T3 which is still broken and C7, which was broken in three parts.  \"That was actually the dangerous one, because one part of this bone went right into the thing where the nerves go and that was the reason why I had to have surgery the next day.  \"I need to start everything slowly and build it up from there, so I'm building my training up, adding more weights each day and my goal is to be back in the car at the end of February or the beginning of March.  \"It depends, of course, how the bone knits together again, but that's the plan and I will try to be fit then again.\" \"It probably is a miracle, but that's probably also the reason why I am happy and why I am normal,\" said the teenager, who celebrated her 18th birthday less than two weeks after the crash. \"It happened quite fast - the top speed was 275kmph - but I can do nearly everything again so, for me, it's just to be happy and to continue to be positive. \"I remember everything from the crash. It felt just completely different for me because it just happened so fast. Speaking about the moment she realised everything had gone wrong, Florsch said: \"[It was when] I didn't have the control any more because I lost my two side wheels because of the other driver, then you're just like 'OK, this is going to be a crash' but I never thought 'this is going to be a really bad crash'.  \"Even when I was in the hospital, for me, the crash wasn't so horrible.  When I saw the video for the first time, I was like 'okay, this actually looks quite bad'. \"When I saw the video for the first time, I was like 'OK, this actually looks quite bad'. \"I watched it for the first time on the Friday after the crash, and of course I was also shocked because it doesn't look nice at all. It's really horrible. \"I didn't expect it to look that bad because, in the car, it didn't feel so horrible. \"So the flying [through the air] part, I remember, but it felt different. For me, it felt like sliding on the ground. I don't know if it's because it happened so fast, but it just felt the same. \"Of course, it was a little bit strange that I was landing on top of the barriers, but I didn't get it together, so I also didn't really think about what it happened. \"The video got quite big and a lot of people saw it. A lot of people texted me, especially F1 drivers like [Fernando] Alonso, [Nico] Rosberg and [Nico] Hulkenberg, but also F1 teams.  \"It's just unbelievable to see how close not just family stays and to have all those fans all over the world supporting you.\" \"My dad was at my car with me and my mum and little sister were at home.

The 19-year-old had both his legs amputated following a crash during a Formula 4 race at Donington Park in April 2017, before returning to racing in March 2018. \"He's a super cool kid and also quite a good friend. What he had to go through is really hard and a lot of people would have said 'OK, I want to stop',\" Florsch added. \"He was already so positive and a happy person before the crash and it's incredibly nice to see that he didn't change at all.  \"He's still this guy who loves racing, who is happy and enjoying life to the edge. \"He was an inspiration for so many people because his story is incredible.

Kante scored the only goal of the game in the 51st minute when he broke forward from midfield to convert David Luiz's throughball. There were few clear-cut chances as the Blues dominated possession and Palace sat back hoping to catch the opposition on the counter-attack - a tactic which failed to work as Roy Hodgson's Eagles took 85 minutes to register their first effort. That is now two successive games without a goal. Chelsea's Willian came close to scoring with a free-kick that struck the post, and Ross Barkley also hit the woodwork with a hooked effort. Fourth-placed Blues now have 43 points, one behind City and two behind Spurs. Palace remain in 14th with 19 points. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The Kante of 2018-19 is made up of different spec to previous models. Gone is the role of anchor man in midfield - the ball-winner who would allow other midfielders to make forays into the opposition's final third. The remodelled version has been given permission to burst forward from the right of a midfield trio. During a largely nondescript opening 45 minutes, he made two runs into the Palace box - the first resulting in a strike that missed Vicente Guaita's far post by two feet. Sarri's perseverance with the tactic paid off six minutes after the break when Kante grabbed his third goal of the season after again breaking from midfield. This time it was defender Luiz the provider, with a threaded pass that found the Frenchman whose shot had enough power to beat the hand of the former Valencia keeper. Willian also went close for the Blues with a free-kick that came off the Palace post, while fellow midfielder Barkley hooked a shot from close range that grazed the woodwork. It was a competent if unremarkable display from Sarri's side, but they did not have to break sweat against a lifeless Palace attack. This was an utterly forgettable display by Palace.  They defended admirably but appeared to show little desire to put pressure on the opposition backline. Their first effort on goal came in the 85th minute when Wilfried Zaha fired wide and high, before substitute Connor Wickham's strike from six yards resulted in a similar outcome. Hodgson grimaced from the sidelines, as must have the Palace supporters inside Selhurst Park. The former England manager explained that his side stuck to their defensive tactics after Chelsea scored because of the risk of \"conceding another three or four\". \"I thought we worked as hard as we could have,\" he said. \"We kept them in front of us and they had the ball, but they were creating goal chances. \"When they scored we had two options; either fly at it and risk conceding another three or four, or keep it tight and try and win an undeserved point in the last 15 minutes.\" \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a difficult match. I am happy with the team because we dominated for 85 minutes, although we didn't kill the match, so we had to fight again for the last five minutes.\" On Kante's goal: \"He is improving with the right timing and good movement and now I think that we have to work on Ross Barkley. We now need continuity because in the last five matches we played very well in three, and badly in two, so now is the moment to have continuity. \"We have to play 19 matches, so other team's results are not important but it is crucial to have continuity.

Palace, who lost 1-0 to Chelsea on Sunday, have scored 17 goals in 20 games this season, the third lowest in the Premier League. \"It's no secret he's a target,\" said Hodgson. \"He's a proven goalscorer through all the age groups.\" Huddersfield and Brighton are also interested in 21-year-old Solanke. It is understood there is also interest from the Championship and clubs outside England. \"He's someone with the profile we're looking for, and the ability we are looking for. We know him better from the England games, and the performances with England,\" said Hodgson. \"If he comes here, it'll be up to him to show he can do that in Premier League football.\" Solanke, a former England youth international who has won one senior cap - against Brazil last year - joined Liverpool from Chelsea on a free transfer in 2017. However, he has not made a first-team appearance for the league leaders this season. He was ruled out of Saturday's 5-1 win over Arsenal with a muscle problem. Hodgson added: \"I thought he was a good signing from Liverpool's point of view, but he's been kept out of the team by some very strong players. \"It would take some player to knock their front three out of the team, so it's not a negative that he's not been able to do so.\"", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/18253657", "content": "ICC team and player rankings Specsavers County Championship Division One averages Specsavers County Championship Division Two averages Royal London One-Day Cup averages NatWest T20 Blast averages", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/46714284", "content": "India saw off Australia by 137 runs in the third Test in Melbourne to take a 2-1 lead in the series.

Jasprit Bumrah, who took career-best match figures of 9-86, had Pat Cummins edge to slip for 63, before Nathan Lyon gloved Ishant Sharma behind. The fourth and final Test starts in Sydney on 2 January. Bumrah's haul was the best by an India pace bowler in Australia and the 25-year-old leads the series standings with 20 wickets, three more than Australia spinner Lyon. \"Credit has to go to the bowlers. I think they have been outstanding, especially Jasprit. The way he bowled in this Test match was outstanding,\" said India captain Virat Kohli, whose side will retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. \"The mindset he has at the moment is what separates him from anyone else in the world right now. He looks at a pitch and he doesn't think it's a hard toil, he thinks wickets, he thinks 'how can I get a breakthrough for the team'. \"What I've seen in the last 12 months is the way he has matured in Test cricket and the way that he is bowling so soon, so quickly in his Test career, I think is a very scary sign for all the batsmen around the world. \"I mean, in Test cricket if there is a pitch like Perth, I wouldn't want to face Jasprit Bumrah, to be honest, because once he's on a roll he can really crank it up.\" India bounced back after losing the second Test in Perth to declare twice at the MCG, with their bowlers tearing Tim Paine's side apart for 151 and 261. The defeat in Melbourne came in Paine's sixth Test match as Australia captain after replacing Steve Smith, who was banned along with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft for ball-tampering during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March. Smith and Warner's year-long suspensions will expire in late March 2019, and Paine admitted Australia missed their presence following a poor batting performance. \"I think it's inexperience, it's pressure, India's bowling attack is probably as good as most of us have ever played,\" he said. \"I think it's pretty clear that if you take two or three of the best players out of anyone's line-up around the world, you're going to struggle a little bit at times and you are going to have inconsistent performances. \"The silver lining is that we do have world-class players that are available soon to come back into this side, and clearly when they do they will make a huge difference.\" With several players under pressure for their place, the Aussies have added all-rounder Marnus Labuschagne to their squad for the final Test.

The review of the higher tariff is a request from President Donald Trump, who wants China to change its trade practices. However, the decision risks escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies. China has already warned it would retaliate if the US went ahead with the plan, accusing Washington of blackmail. \"If the US side takes steps to further escalate the situation, we will definitely take countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our legitimate and legal rights and interests,\" said foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang on Wednesday.  The White House says the tariffs are a response to China's unfair trade policies, which Mr Trump blames for helping to create a huge trade deficit. A first round of tariffs came into effect on 6 July, when the US imposed 25% taxes on $34bn of Chinese imports. China retaliated in kind. Tariffs on another $16bn of products are pending, the second part of tariffs on $50bn worth of imports that the US announced in March. US threats have escalated since, with the President saying he is ready to impose tariffs on all $500bn of Chinese imports. In July, the US published a list of $200bn worth of additional products to be hit with tariffs of 10% - a figure the US is now considering raising to 25%. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said: \"The increase in the possible rate of the additional duty is intended to provide the administration with additional options to encourage China to change its harmful policies and behaviour and adopt policies that will lead to fairer markets and prosperity for all of our citizens.\"   The list named more than 6,000 items worth $200bn in annual trade, including chemicals, textiles, minerals and consumer goods ranging from baseball gloves to frozen fish fillets. Before the tariffs go into effect, they are subject to a public comment period. The duties could take effect as soon as September. Some US politicians expressed support for the White House move. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted \"the only way to remove barriers is to demonstrate to [China] our willingness to retaliate with barriers\". But other groups condemned the idea, saying the taxes would ultimately raise costs for US households and businesses. \"China's trade abuses need to be addressed, but tariffs are not the answer,\" the National Retail Federation said. The White House may hope that higher stakes force China to make concessions, but that is a risky bet, said Mickey Kantor, a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown who served as US commerce secretary under former president Bill Clinton. \"I don't think you can intimidate the Chinese into doing something they don't want to do,\" he told the BBC. The decision to turn to tariffs, instead of working with allies to negotiate, is undermining respect for international trade rules, he added. \"We're going to have globalisation whether some people like it or not .... The only question is, are we going to have any rules that apply,\" he said.

US President Donald Trump had been complaining about China's trading practices even before he took office in 2016.  That year he said China engaged in the \"rape\" of the US economy, and since then he has aggressively targeted Beijing as part of his broader America First agenda.  In 2017, the  US launched an investigation into Chinese trade policies and has steadily imposed tariffs on Chinese products from this year.  So far, the US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods, totalling more than $250bn (\u00a3191.9bn). They cover a wide range of consumer and industrial items including handbags, rice and  railway equipment. The duties range from 10% to 25%. Mr Trump has since threatened to hit another $267bn worth of goods - meaning all Chinese imports could be subject to tariffs.  The US has also put tariffs on worldwide imports of goods like steel and washing machines, which further affects products from China. Beijing has struck back. It's accused the US of starting \"the largest trade war in economic history\" and imposed tariffs on $110bn worth of American goods.  China's list of products subject to levies - which range from 5% to 25% - includes chemicals, coal and medical equipment. The moves have been strategic, targeting products made in Republican districts, and goods - like soybeans - that can be purchased elsewhere. Tariffs, in theory, make US-made products cheaper than imported ones, and encourage consumers to buy American. Already there are signs of economic strain.  Both US and international firms have said they are being harmed.

US equipment maker Caterpillar on Monday said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. But while higher prices are shielding some firms, others are under strain. On the same day, food processor Tyson Foods cut its profit forecast, saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.70-$6 for its 2018 financial year due to a surplus in US supply caused by the tariffs. That was down from its earlier $6.55-$6.70 forecast. Lower prices for beef and pork have also reduced demand for chicken, the firm added. \"The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,\" said Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods president and chief executive officer.  The updates were the latest from businesses explaining how trade disputes are raising costs and shifting demand for products that range from cars to beer. In March, the US announced tariffs on steel and aluminium, prompting China, the European Union, Mexico and other places to retaliate with import taxes on US products such as pork, wine and whiskey. Separately, the US and China have also imposed tit-for-tat tariffs of $34bn on the other country's goods, in a row over intellectual property practices and state subsidies. While some firms, including Caterpillar, have said they will pass on higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, others are more constrained. BMW, for example, has said it would raise prices in China by 4%-7% on two SUV models, which are US-made. But the rise will not completely absorb the cost of China's new taxes on US vehicles, the firm warned. Harley Davidson told investors it plans to shoulder the cost of European tariffs on US-made motorcycles in order to remain competitive. It is also grappling with higher steel and aluminium prices. Overall, analysts expect the duties to have a relatively modest impact. Analysts at US bank Wells Fargo estimate that the US tariffs so far will boost inflation in the US by 0.1%, but said that the rise could be softened by price declines for products targeted by other countries for retaliation. The changes come as higher fuel and labour costs fuel stronger inflation in the US. The index for producer prices climbed 3.4% over the 12 months to July, the strongest annual gain since November 2011, according to figures from the US Labor Department. The consumer price index increased 2.9% over the 12 months to June.

But as always - the devil is in the detail - and truth be told, there's not much detail when it comes to this deal.  So let's unpick their agreement. This was a deal that both sides needed to play well at home.  Which is why it was interesting that the first inkling we had of an agreement actually came from Chinese media.  Both China Daily and Chinese international broadcaster CGTN said that President Trump and President Xi had agreed not to impose new tariffs after 1 January.  President Xi has been grappling with a slowing economy at home, and analysts say he's been under pressure to come home with some sort of a deal that wouldn't exert more pain on Chinese manufacturers. There's some evidence that companies in China are seeing some pain because of the trade war, but for now, at the 10% level, it's been manageable. A 25% increase would change things dramatically.  Ditto for President Trump. US lobby groups have pressed him to put aside differences with China and pointed out that higher tariffs would mean higher costs for American manufacturers - which would in turn lead to higher prices for US consumers.  He's publicly brushed aside those concerns before, but this deal will help him look strong back home, whilst also granting US companies more time to figure out what to do if the next set of tariffs do come into effect. The US, at first glance, does come out better in this deal.  President Trump has managed to get China to agree to talk about some key problems his administration has with the way Beijing does business - and an agreement to get China to buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and industrial goods from the US.  There's also the Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors deal - an unwitting victim of the trade war -  that President Xi said he \"is open to\" approving, after Beijing failed to approve the merger earlier this year.  Analysts say we could see a possible approval on that front if the talks over the next 12 weeks go well. President Trump also praised China on North Korea - a key part of his relationship with President Xi, and that the two will work towards a nuclear free Korean peninsula.  But China has also ensured that the language of this agreement is vague, and non binding - which means it is not clear at all how much Beijing has to open up, or how much it will buy from the US. This is a key part of the agreement. China and the US have agreed to immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft, services and agriculture - within the next 90 days.  If they cannot reach an agreement, the 10% tariffs will be raised up to 25%. This deadline takes us past the Chinese New Year holiday, and basically buys both sides more time.  The US wants China to give up forced technology transfers and give American firms more access to the Chinese market.  Whether China has the same definition of what that means, will be the key gauge of whether their talks are successful. But things are changing in Beijing, at least according to an editorial in the Global Times, often seen as a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.  In today's edition, commenting on the Xi-Trump truce, it says \"Any decision that benefits China's development is right.\"  Perhaps from a position of self-interest, this temporary reprieve is worth sacrificing for.  How much China will sacrifice though, will be key to whether this deal is anything more than just a temporary truce, or a long-lasting definitive re-writing of the US-China relationship. Interestingly the 90 day timeline doesn't appear to get much of a mention in Chinese media - which may be trying to spin this as a complete victory for President Xi, rather than what it is: a temporary truce for the Christmas holidays.  No more tit-for-tat tweets, or tariff threats - for now at least.  But without real specifics, and some serious giving in from China, it is hard to see that we won't be back at this position in three months' time.  And next time - it will be for real - and not just on trade.  There are already rumblings in the Trump White House of restricting visas to Chinese academics and students.

He said de-listing from the stock exchange meant Tesla, currently valued at $63.8bn (\u00a350bn), would no longer be under the glare of Wall Street.  In an unusual move, Mr Musk first made the announcement on Twitter rather than via an official regulatory disclosure. But analysts are sceptical about what would be the biggest buyout in history.  Since Tesla floated on the stock market, Mr Musk has clashed with analysts and complained that quarterly scrutiny of the firm's finances encourages short-term thinking. Tesla shares ended the day 11% up at almost $380 per share - close to their all-time high. Mr Musk said shareholders would be offered $420 per share, valuing the business at more than $80bn, including debt. A buyout at that value would make it by far the biggest such deal. The current biggest is the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium that included KKR and TPG. Mr Musk claimed to have secured funding to buy out shareholders, but did not provide details. However, he also warned that \"a final decision has not been made\" about the move. Any buy-out would need a shareholder vote. BBC business editor Simon Jack said that if it emerges that Mr Musk did not have solid financial backing for a buyout he could be in trouble with regulators for share price manipulation. While Twitter was an unconventional way to make the announcement, the US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, allows firms to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter in this way provided investors have been told which social media outlets will be used. In 2013, Tesla flagged Mr Musk's Twitter account as a source of information.  The firm subsequently shared a message from Mr Musk to employees that explained the thinking behind his announcement.  Mr Musk, who owns almost 20% of the company, said he hoped the move would shield the firm from distracting swings in the share price and the pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. He also said he wanted to end \"negative propaganda\" from short sellers, investors who bet on the shares of a firm going down. \"Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,\" he wrote. Mr Musk has discussed the drawbacks of being a public company before. But his tweets stirred confusion initially, given his history of informal use of the social media service. For example, on April Fool's Day, he joked on Twitter about Tesla going bankrupt.  Mr Musk's plan would allow investors to choose to retain their holdings. He planned to hold onto his shares and hoped to continue as chief executive, he added.  Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, said Mr Musk had a \"one-in-three chance\" of managing to succeed with his plan. \"The 16% premium to the current share price may not be high enough to incentivise existing shareholders to support the sale,\" he added.  And Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise finance when Tesla has still not made a profit.  \"The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?\" he said. Elon Musk had better have the money lined up to take Tesla private or he could be in serious trouble with regulators. There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each. The shares surged, which will have left the people who have been betting the shares would fall nursing very heavy losses. It will have given Mr Musk great pleasure to get one over on the naysayers. But he's playing a potentially dangerous game. If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation. It's a very serious charge, which can land you in jail. Read Simon's blog. Mr Musk's disclosure stirred further speculation about Tesla's future. The firm is spending heavily as it ramps up production of its latest car, the Model 3. It reported a record loss in its most recent quarter, and some analysts say it will need to raise money in order to survive. However, Mr Musk has said he has no plans to do so and promised that the firm will be profitable in the second half of the year, barring any unforeseen events. The tweets came after a separate report in the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had taken a 3%-5% stake in Tesla, a holding worth at least $1.9bn. The article said the state fund, overseen by the powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been interested in buying newly issued shares.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46135276", "content": "Tesla has named an Australian executive as its new chairman after Elon Musk was forced to give up the role. Robyn Denholm, the finance chief of Australian telecoms firm Telstra, takes over from the electric car maker's founder, who remains chief executive. Mr Musk agreed to step down as chair last month to resolve claims of fraud brought by US financial regulators.  The settlement requires Tesla to install an independent chairman, among other penalties. The announcement scotches reports that James Murdoch was the frontrunner for the job. Tesla has endured a difficult few months, following comments Mr Musk made on social media in early August suggesting he had \"funding secured\" for a deal to take Tesla private.  Its shares soared following his comments but weeks later Mr Musk backed away from the plan, blaming feedback from shareholders. US authorities sued the entrepreneur for misleading investors and he and Tesla were each fined $20m. Mr Musk was also obliged to relinquish his role as chairman for three years. Investors had also called for stronger oversight of Mr Musk after his erratic behaviour attracted attention. In media interviews he said he often slept on a sofa in the Tesla office and more recently in an online video he briefly smoked marijuana. Tesla, which has never reported an annual profit, also came under strain over production schedules for its Model 3 electric car, its newest car aimed at a wider market. However, the carmaker made what Mr Musk called an \"historic\" profit in the most recent quarter. Ms Denholm, who has been on Tesla's board since August 2014, became Telstra CFO in July.  She will take on the full-time role at Tesla after serving a six-month notice period at the Australian firm.  \"I believe in this company, I believe in its mission and I look forward to helping Elon and the Tesla team achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value,\" Ms Denholm said. Before moving to Telstra, she worked for Silicon Valley firms Sun Microsystems and Juniper Networks as well as consultants Arthur Anderson and Toyota. \"Robyn has extensive experience in both the tech and auto industries, and she has made significant contributions as a Tesla board member over the past four years in helping us become a profitable company,\" said Mr Musk.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46507964", "content": "Elon Musk says he has \"no respect\" for the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) financial regulator.

The firm's future hangs on the Model 3 sedan, but it has so far struggled with production bottlenecks. Tesla reported a loss of $675.4m (\u00a3487m) in three months to 31 December, compared with $121.3m a year earlier.  But it said revenues rose to $3.29bn, up from $2.28bn, and that it was addressing Model 3 production issues. \"At some point in 2018, we expect to begin generating positive quarterly operating income on a sustained basis,\" Tesla, which is yet to make a profit, said on Wednesday.  Despite ongoing production bottlenecks, the electric car maker said it would continue to target Model 3 production rates of 2,500 by the end of the first quarter this year, and 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.  However, it added a caveat that \"our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time.\"  The Model 3 went on sale in the US last year priced at $35,000. It is a medium-sized car which Tesla describes as its most affordable, and hopes it will have a mass market appeal. It is significantly cheaper than Tesla's current models - the Model X, an SUV, and the Model S, a sporty saloon, both priced at more than $70,000.  Analysts said first impressions of the company's results were upbeat. \"No further delays in Model 3 production anticipated should be taken positively,\" said Efraim Levy from CFRA Research. Investors were not as confident however and the company's shares dipped in after-hours trading.  Tesla was founded in 2003 and is controlled by entrepreneur Elon Musk, who also owns the space rocket firm, SpaceX. It has 330 store and service locations worldwide.

The job cuts at Elon Musk's electric car maker come as it tries to increase production of its Model 3 sedan and turn a quarterly profit this year. Tesla said the more than 3,000 cuts would affect mostly salaried employees and not those making its cars. Mr Musk said the move had been a \"difficult decision\". Tesla employed more than 37,000 people at the end of last year. \"Given that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us,\" he wrote in an email to employees and posted on Twitter.  \"What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we can eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable.\" Is Tesla heading for trouble? Musk: No 'bonehead' questions please Last month Mr Musk said the company was planning a wide-ranging reorganisation that would flatten its management structure. In the email, he said the cuts are aimed at eliminating duplicate roles and he does not expect them to affect the firm's production ability. Tesla employees based at US DIY chain Home Depot and involved with the home solar business Tesla acquired when it bought SolarCity are among those affected, he said.  The \"majority\" of those workers will be offered positions in Tesla's retail business, Mr Musk added. Michelle Krebs, an Autotrader analyst, said the job cuts were not a surprise. \"It is clear that Tesla is under tremendous pressure to finally turn a profit and is attempting to address it by cutting overhead,\" she said.  \"Also notable is Tesla is not cutting production jobs at a time when pushing Model 3s out the door is a top priority.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45971786", "content": "Tesla has reported a quarterly profit for just the third time in its 15-year history.  The electric car-maker made a record $311.5m (\u00a3241m) in the three months to 30 September, as the pace of car deliveries accelerated.  The result is a victory for chief executive Elon Musk, who had promised a profit to investors earlier this year.  Tesla's last profitable quarter came in 2016 and it had faced mounting questions about its finances. In a letter to investors, Mr Musk called the quarter \"historic\" and said it was a credit to the firm's \"ingenuity and incredible hard work\". He also said Tesla was on track to be profitable again in the fourth quarter. Shares jumped more than 10% in after-hours trading in New York. The results are a sign that the firm has turned a corner, said Nicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Normally we'd tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter's numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla,\" he said. Tesla, which has never reported an annual profit, had been under particular strain after it ramped up spending for its launch of the Model 3, its newest car aimed at a wider market. Following a surge of orders last year, it struggled to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers. That prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings. However, less than a fifth of the roughly 455,000 reservations the firm reported in 2017 have been cancelled, it said. Production has also picked up, driving sales. Tesla made more than 80,000 vehicles in the period, of which more than 60% were Model 3s. The increase lifted revenue to $6.8bn in the quarter, more than double a year ago. Job cuts and other reductions in spending also helped the bottom line. Akshay Anand, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book, called it a \"very strong\" quarterly performance. \"Kudos to Elon Musk and team for surprising nearly everyone,\" he said. \"Now, the question remains - can Tesla make this a habit, or [is] this a blip on the radar?\"  On a call with financial analysts, Mr Musk said Tesla aimed to be profitable every quarter going forward.  He is counting on strong demand in Europe and China, where Tesla plans to start selling Model 3s next year. The aim is to shift up to a million cars a year outside the US. Tesla hopes to start production of its next model in 2020 and is also making plans for a Tesla ride-hailing service, Mr Musk added.  The quarterly profit milestone was a boost to the Tesla chief, who has been criticised for not delivering on previous promises and other recent behaviour, such as Twitter attacks on a British diver. Last month the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, accused him of defrauding investors when he claimed he had secured funding to take Tesla private. The two sides later announced a settlement, in which Mr Musk would step aside as chairman and pay a fine, among other penalties, but could remain Tesla chief executive.

In the interview, Mr Musk also said he was not \"on weed\" when he controversially tweeted about taking the company private.  After the comments from Mr Musk, shares were down 8.8%. The share drop was encouraged by a UBS note predicting Tesla's Model 3 will lose $6,000 per vehicle, as costs soar. The ramping up of production of the electric car company's mass-market Model 3 was one of the reasons why Mr Musk admitted to being overworked and using the sedative Ambien to help sleep, he said in the interview. The  New York Times interview also discussed his 7 August tweet when the CEO said he wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a share.  Mr Musk said the price of $420 seemed like \"better karma\" than $419. \"But I was not on weed, to be clear,\" he said, as he also confirmed the tweet was not reviewed by anyone at the electric car company. 4/20 is an infamous term, more common in the US, that refers to the consumption of cannabis. The price of $419 would have represented a 20% premium over Tesla's share price at the time.  \"It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419. But I was not on weed, to be clear.  \"Weed is not helpful for productivity. There's a reason for the word 'stoned'. You just sit there like a stone on weed,\" Mr Musk, 47, said. He also told the paper that friends had expressed concern that he was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks. \"This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\" he said. \"It was excruciating.\" The paper reported that at times during the interview he stopped speaking, seemingly overcome by emotion - and that he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday on 28 June working.  \"All night - no friends, nothing,\" Mr Musk said. Mr Musk also said that he took the sedative Ambien to help him sleep when he was not working: \"It is often a choice of no sleep, or Ambien.\" According to the paper, his use of the drug has concerned some board members, who wonder if it affects his late-night tweets. In May Roseanne Barr blamed Ambien for her tweet that likened Valerie Jarrett, an African-American former aide to Barack Obama, to an ape. His tweet about taking Tesla private sparked a sharp rally in Tesla's share price, but has also prompted scrutiny. London hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who is shorting Tesla stock, has joined a number of analysts disproving of Mr Musk's running of the company. According to Bloomberg, Mr Odey told investors: \"Tesla feels like it is entering the final stage of its life.\" Fox News  has reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sent subpoenas to the electric carmaker and was \"ramping up\" its investigation into the tweet. Tesla's directors said: \"There have been many false and irresponsible rumours in the press about the discussions of the Tesla board.  \"We would like to make clear that Elon's commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious.  \"Over the past 15 years, Elon's leadership of the Tesla team has caused Tesla to grow from a small start-up to having hundreds of thousands of cars on the road that customers love, employing tens of thousands of people around the world, and creating significant shareholder value in the process.\" The statement was issued by the board members, excluding Mr Musk, who controls about a fifth of Tesla shares. The board has set up a committee to evaluate any take-private proposal from Mr Musk, who has said that he discussed funding a deal with the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.  The New York Times reported that Mr Musk did not intend to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive, but that a search was underway to recruit a deputy.  However, he said there was \"no active search\" underway. He added: \"If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know.

Under the deal, Mr Musk will remain as Tesla CEO but has to step down as chairman for three years. Both he and Tesla will also have to pay a $20m (\u00a315m) fine. The SEC's chairman Jay Clayton said that he supported the deal, and felt that it was in the best interests of US markets and investors, including the shareholders of Tesla. \"This matter reaffirms an important principle embodied in our disclosure-based federal securities laws,\" he said. \"Specifically, when companies and corporate insiders make statements, they must act responsibly, including endeavouring to ensure the statements are not false or misleading and do not omit information a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision.\" The fraud allegation relates to his August tweet in which Mr Musk said he was considering taking electronic car maker Tesla off the stock market and into private ownership. He wrote he had \"funding secured\" for the proposal, which would value Tesla at $420 per share. Shares in the company briefly rose after his announcement, but later fell again. The SEC said those claims were \"false and misleading\". \"In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,\" the regulator said. Mr Musk initially responded to the charges by saying the action was \"unjustified\" and he acted in the \"best interests of truth, transparency and investors\". In addition to the fines, Mr Musk will also have to comply with company communications procedures when tweeting about the firm. He now has 45 days to leave his role as chairman of Tesla.  The SEC had initially sought to ban Mr Musk from working on the board of any publicly traded company, but under the deal he will now be able to stay on as Tesla's chief executive officer. A new \"independent chairman\" for the company will be appointed, who will preside over the company's board. Forcing Tesla to separate the roles of CEO and chairman should limit Mr Musk's power within the company.  Despite this, many analysts say the outcome is a good one for Mr Musk, given he remains in charge of day-to-day operations as CEO. Born in South Africa, Mr Musk made millions from online payments firm PayPal before moving on to Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.  He is the 25th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, which estimates his net worth to be $19.7bn  (\u00a315.1bn). But it has been a volatile summer for the entrepreneur. Mr Musk is being sued for defamation after making allegations against a British diver involved in the Thai cave rescue. Earlier this month, he found himself in another controversy after appearing on a podcast while smoking marijuana.

The plan was cancelled after a board meeting on Thursday, he wrote in a post published on the company's site. Since Mr Musk announced his plan to delist Tesla, its share price has dropped by 20%. He said he had told the board \"that I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public,\" and that they agreed. Mr Musk, who owns about a fifth of the company, said he had spoken with shareholders and major banks to consider the privatisation but found the sentiment was \"please don't do this\". Earlier this month, Elon Musk shocked investors by announcing on Twitter that he had funding secured to take Tesla private at a value of $72bn (\u00a357bn).  It later transpired that he had not closed a deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, with unhappy investors launching a lawsuit against him after the news.  The lawsuits are still continuing against Mr Musk despite his cancellation of the privatisation plan, as is an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to see if the tweet broke securities laws.  The billionaire entrepreneur has complained since floating the company on the stock market that quarterly scrutiny of Tesla's finances encourages short-term thinking. But in a follow up tweet after his blog post, he said talks with shareholders had persuaded him otherwise. Tesla shares rose sharply on 7 August following Mr Musk's suggestion he would take Tesla private, but have continued to fall since then. The slide has been good news for short sellers, who bet that Tesla's share price would fall. Mr Musk has a well-known dislike of short sellers, whom he has called \"jerks who want us to die\" and has argued that taking Tesla off the stock exchange would shield it from their attacks. Shares fell even further after Mr Musk gave an emotional interview to the New York Times, in which he said he was working 120 hour weeks and had been using sedatives.  Tesla directors reportedly told him to restrict his use of Twitter in recent days, according to the paper.  Tesla has faced growing financial pressures this year as it works to build more of its Model 3 cars. On 1 August, as Tesla reported another record loss, Mr Musk said he expected the company to be profitable in the second half of 2018 and every quarter going forward.

It does not believe the changeover will lead to a further delay. The Emergency Services Network (ESN) was originally due to be completed by the end of 2019. At that point it was meant to replace an existing Motorola-owned radio system called Airwave, which is used by the police, fire and rescue, and ambulance services. The ESN is intended to give its users \"secure\" priority access to EE's 4G network, which is being extended via additional radio frequencies in rural areas and new mast sites. It should be cheaper to run than Airwave while also providing superior voice and data capabilities.

Since then, it has become subject to a BT policy that Huawei's kit should not be used at the core of its mobile networks to push customers' data about.

The US and Australia had already closed the door on Huawei's involvement in their next-generation mobile networks. That means three members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance have now acted against the Shenzhen-based company. And one other member, Canada, is carrying out a security review of its own.  So, there's a prospect that the UK could soon be the sole holdout, allowing Huawei to play a key role in delivering the data that everything from self-driving cars to smart city sensors will rely on. \"There are two factors at play here: 5G will be connected to everything as we go to the internet-of-things,\" said Ewan Lawson, from UK defence think tank Rusi. \"And concerns about foreign-sourced hardware were less intense than they are now.\" For its part, Huawei has said: \"[We are] aware of Spark's statement and we are looking into the situation. \"As a leading global supplier of telecoms equipment, we remain committed to developing trusted and secure solutions for our customers.\" The government argues not. \"This government and British telecoms operators work with Huawei at home and abroad to ensure the UK can continue to benefit from new technology while managing cyber-security risks,\" a Cabinet Office spokeswoman told BBC News. That work includes a facility nicknamed the Cell, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where staff employed by Huawei but answering to GCHQ hunt for security flaws in the company's products. It has not uncovered evidence of hidden backdoors or other deliberate attempts of subterfuge. But its last report did identify shortcomings that led it to warn that it could offer only \"limited assurance\" that the company posed no threat. The UK government is also thought to have fired a shot across the bows last month, when it wrote to telecoms companies warning that a review of  their infrastructure could lead to \"changes in the current rules\" that should be taken into account during \"procurement decisions\". Huawei was not mentioned by name, but the Financial Times - which revealed the letter's existence - said some industry executives interpreted it to mean a ban was still possible. But others have their doubts, noting that other political factors are at play. \"The letter did go out but the issue remains that in the absence of any definitive evidence of a problem, an unspecific security risk has to be weighed against trade opportunities,\" said Mr Lawson. \"If Huawei was banned, we don't know the extent to which China might well refuse to do business with us in other fields - and the timing for that would not be great with so much attention on the potential economic impacts of Brexit.\" Huawei opened its first office in the country in 2001 and soon had its equipment adopted by BT and Vodafone, which used it to support 2G, 3G and 4G mobile services as well as \"superfast\" fibre and other types of broadband connections to homes and businesses. Its kit includes mobile phone radio antennas and the routers and switches found in kerbside cabinets. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - are now working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings.  O2's parent Telefonica has also tested its new equipment elsewhere and signalled that it might use it in the UK. In addition, Huawei says it has developed research and development partnerships with many of the country's leading academic institutions, including the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Cardiff and Imperial College. Its UK board of directors includes Lord Browne, the former chief of BP, and Sir Andrew Cahn, a former high-ranking civil servant.  The company is keen to portray itself as a private company owned by its employees with no ties to the Chinese government beyond those of a law-abiding taxpayer. It can also lay claim to being one of the biggest spenders on research and development - it invested more than $13.2bn (\u00a310.3bn) last year and has said the figure will be even higher for 2018. But critics like to point out that its media-shy founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. Furthermore, they question how free any major Chinese business can be from Beijing's influence. \"It's accepted practice in China that relationships between Chinese companies and the state have to be extremely close,\" said Prof Anthony Glees, director of the Buckingham University Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies. \"Many other countries have said no [to Huawei over 5G].  \"We've come to the matter late as we have already let them through the door.\" Another leading cyber-security expert agreed that Huawei could be co-opted into incapacitating the equipment it had sold. \"The obvious concern with 5G is whether there is a material risk of the Chinese being in a position to run a big denial-of-service attack on Britain in the event of a time of international tension,\" said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge. \"There is obviously a risk. China plays hardball and we have been hoping in vain for years that it would get nice as it got richer but that hasn't happened.\" For now, Beijing has been reticent to be seen to be too forceful in leaping to Huawei's defence. The Chinese government did warn against \"protectionism\" when a deal to sell Huawei's phones in the US fell through and then \"discriminatory practices\" when Australia banned local networks using its 5G equipment. But Chinese officials are already preoccupied with President Trump's threats of more trade tariffs and might see any effort to try to help Huawei as likely to backfire. Even so, eyebrows have still been raised by a decision to exclude its founder from a list of 100 key contributors to China's economy over the past 40 years recently published in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper.

That work includes a facility nicknamed the Cell, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where staff employed by Huawei but answering to GCHQ hunt for security flaws in the company's products. It has not uncovered evidence of hidden backdoors or other deliberate attempts of subterfuge. But its last report did identify shortcomings that led it to warn that it could offer only \"limited assurance\" that the company posed no threat. The UK government is also thought to have fired a shot across the bows last month, when it wrote to telecoms companies warning that a review of  their infrastructure could lead to \"changes in the current rules\" that should be taken into account during \"procurement decisions\". Huawei was not mentioned by name, but the Financial Times - which revealed the letter's existence - said some industry executives interpreted it to mean a ban was still possible. But others have their doubts, noting that other political factors are at play. \"The letter did go out but the issue remains that in the absence of any definitive evidence of a problem, an unspecific security risk has to be weighed against trade opportunities,\" said Mr Lawson. \"If Huawei was banned, we don't know the extent to which China might well refuse to do business with us in other fields - and the timing for that would not be great with so much attention on the potential economic impacts of Brexit.\" Huawei opened its first office in the country in 2001 and soon had its equipment adopted by BT and Vodafone, which used it to support 2G, 3G and 4G mobile services as well as \"superfast\" fibre and other types of broadband connections to homes and businesses. Its kit includes mobile phone radio antennas and the routers and switches found in kerbside cabinets. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - are now working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings.  O2's parent Telefonica has also tested its new equipment elsewhere and signalled that it might use it in the UK. In addition, Huawei says it has developed research and development partnerships with many of the country's leading academic institutions, including the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Cardiff and Imperial College. Its UK board of directors includes Lord Browne, the former chief of BP, and Sir Andrew Cahn, a former high-ranking civil servant.  The company is keen to portray itself as a private company owned by its employees with no ties to the Chinese government beyond those of a law-abiding taxpayer. It can also lay claim to being one of the biggest spenders on research and development - it invested more than $13.2bn (\u00a310.3bn) last year and has said the figure will be even higher for 2018. But critics like to point out that its media-shy founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. Furthermore, they question how free any major Chinese business can be from Beijing's influence. \"It's accepted practice in China that relationships between Chinese companies and the state have to be extremely close,\" said Prof Anthony Glees, director of the Buckingham University Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies. \"Many other countries have said no [to Huawei over 5G].  \"We've come to the matter late as we have already let them through the door.\" Another leading cyber-security expert agreed that Huawei could be co-opted into incapacitating the equipment it had sold. \"The obvious concern with 5G is whether there is a material risk of the Chinese being in a position to run a big denial-of-service attack on Britain in the event of a time of international tension,\" said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge. \"There is obviously a risk. China plays hardball and we have been hoping in vain for years that it would get nice as it got richer but that hasn't happened.\" For now, Beijing has been reticent to be seen to be too forceful in leaping to Huawei's defence. The Chinese government did warn against \"protectionism\" when a deal to sell Huawei's phones in the US fell through and then \"discriminatory practices\" when Australia banned local networks using its 5G equipment. But Chinese officials are already preoccupied with President Trump's threats of more trade tariffs and might see any effort to try to help Huawei as likely to backfire. Even so, eyebrows have still been raised by a decision to exclude its founder from a list of 100 key contributors to China's economy over the past 40 years recently published in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper. Whether that is because Mr Ren is viewed as being too close or not close enough to the government is unclear.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37760187", "content": "The government has approved a third runway at Heathrow to expand UK airport capacity following a cabinet committee meeting on Tuesday. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the \"truly momentous\" decision would support trade and create jobs. Gatwick airport said it was disappointed with the decision, which was \"not the right answer for Britain\". The issue has split the Cabinet, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson saying a third runway was \"undeliverable\". The Education Secretary, Justine Greening, whose Putney constituency in southwest London is near the airport, has also been a vocal critic of Heathrow expansion. The Department for Transport said a new runway at Heathrow would bring economic benefits to passengers and the wider economy worth up to \u00a361bn and create as many as 77,000 additional local jobs over the next 14 years. Heathrow said the expansion would allow it to offer more direct flights to UK destinations as well as up to 40 new cities abroad such as Wuhan, Osaka and Quito. Live: Airport expansion decision What happens next? Why expansion is taking so long Is new runway more important post-Brexit? The green price of Heathrow expansion Death sentence for Heathrow villages A public consultation will now be held on the effects of airport expansion before the government makes a final decision as part of a national policy statement on aviation. MPs will then vote on that decision in the winter of 2017-18.  It is unlikely that any new runway capacity would be operational before 2025. Construction is not likely to begin until 2020 or 2021, the Airports Commission has said. Mr Johnson, the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London, doubted whether construction would ever start: \"The day when the bulldozers appear is a long way off, if indeed they ever materialise.\" Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, also said expanding the west London airport was the wrong decision for both London and the UK.  \"There are more people affected by noise because of Heathrow than people affected by the airports in Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Munich and Madrid combined,\" he said. \"The air in London is a killer. It makes you sick and it's unlawful.\" Greenpeace UK chief John Sauven said a third runway at Heathrow would increase air pollution and \"be a waste of time, money and lives\". Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, said opposition from predominantly Tory-controlled councils, communities and MPs meant \"the chances of a toxic third runway being built are vanishingly small\". However, a wide range of unions and business groups welcomed the decision to expand Heathrow. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it was \"absolutely vital for Britain\", while CBI chief Paul Drechsler said it would create jobs and boost economic growth.  Heathrow management said the airport was ready to deliver a third runway that was \"fair, affordable and secures the benefits of expansion for the whole of the UK\". Expanding airport capacity in the South East of England has been a political hot potato for many years, which is why successive governments have attempted to duck the issue. Although Heathrow has always been the favourite among businesses, it has attracted the most opposition from MPs with constituencies near the airport or under flight paths.  A study last year led by Sir Howard Davies recommended a third runway at Heathrow, but other options included a new runway at Gatwick or extending one of Heathrow's existing runways. Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP for Richmond Park, has resigned in protest against the decision, which he called \"catastrophic\". The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency includes Heathrow, said the announcement was the start, rather than the end, of the process.  \"It beggars belief that it has taken ministers over a year since the publication of the Davies report to even make that start,\" he said. \"There is no justification for dithering on this scale.\" We have a long way to go before we see the proverbial shovels in the ground - there will be legal and planning challenges aplenty to come. However, with today's decision to recommend a third runway, this government has arrived at a point its predecessors failed to, with a real prospect of action. From beating ourselves up for not being able to build anything, the UK is suddenly building everything.  Heathrow was chosen because of the extra boost it gives to the UK economy, but it is not the only mammoth project out there. After a last-minute wobble, the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station was given the green light, while the biggest project of them all is coming down the track fast.  Construction on the \u00a342bn HS2 is scheduled to begin next year - and that is probably not all. Chancellor Philip Hammond has hinted he may reveal some moderate borrowing to fund targeted infrastructure spending in his Autumn Statement next month. It's enough to make the Victorians sit up and take notice. If projections for a fairly sharp post-Brexit slowdown in the economy next year are correct then we may need this spending boost. If these projects proceed on time, there is something else we will need: people to build all this stuff. With unemployment close to historic lows, it's not clear we have enough. Like the Victorians did, it seems very likely we will need to look abroad to find the workers for our golden age of infrastructure - and that, post-Brexit, will present a political rather than an engineering challenge. Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, welcomed the decision to expand Heathrow but added: \"The government's directive to cap customer charges at today's level is fundamental. Heathrow is the world's most expensive hub airport so it's critical that new capacity is affordable.\"  His counterpart at Virgin Atlantic, Craig Kreeger, described the announcement as an exciting opportunity to radically transform airline competition at the UK's main airport\". The airline would strive to ensure that passengers were not \"overburdened by paying for runways and facilities that won't be open until the mid-2020s\".", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46632302", "content": "Passengers whose travel plans continue to be disrupted at Gatwick after the runway was closed for 36 hours are facing extra costs from rearranged flights, car parking and hotels. Although the circumstances that caused the disruption - drones flown around the runway - are unusual, there are still specific rights for air travellers. It is important to note that extra compensation, which is normally paid under EU rules if the delay is the fault of the airline, will not be paid in this case, as the closure of Gatwick was beyond the airlines' control. The Civil Aviation Authority has confirmed this incident is \"an extraordinary circumstance\", so no extra compensation should be paid. To be clear, that does not mean that passengers should be completely left out of pocket. It is the airline's responsibility to get anyone with a ticket to their destination, unless the passenger accepts a refund instead. The airline has a duty of care to passengers in this situation. That means they must look after their customers until they can get them on an alternative flight to their destination. That might be a re-routed flight, perhaps including a stopover, or the soonest possible flight now Gatwick has reopened. They can put customers on a flight with a different airline. If the alternative flight leaves or arrives at a different airport, the airline must transport passengers to the original departure or arrival point without charge. Some passengers will choose to take a refund instead, but Adam French, of consumer group Which?, says that the airline's duty of care ends at that moment. That means someone who takes the refund and books their own - more expensive - alternative flight is unlikely to have the difference reimbursed. If a flight is still expected to depart, but late, then passengers will initially have to wait rather than be put on an alternative flight. However, for delays of more than five hours, passengers get the same rights as they would if the flight was cancelled. So, after five hours, they could be offered a refund or an alternative flight. That will be true of many passengers now. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the BBC that he hoped insurers would take \"an enlightened view\" about payouts. \"This is something that should be covered under travel insurance policies. We will talk to the insurance industry today to make sure they treat claims reasonably,\" he said. However, not all policies cover disruption or so-called travel abandonment. Sometimes this requires the customer to tick a box when applying for a travel policy. Policies may cover the extra costs that airlines do not pick up - such as a hotel stay or car hire overseas - and insurers have said they want to honour that, despite the unusual circumstances. Travel insurance claims should be a last resort. Any claims for extra costs should first be made to the airline.    Gatwick says that passengers should not travel to the airport without checking the status of the flight with the airline first. Many airlines send out automatic alerts.  There is also searchable live flight information published on the Gatwick Airport website.  The airline must get you from A to B, so they must put you on the next possible flight to your intended destination. Travel organisation Abta says a \"through\" ticket is legally treated as one contract, so your initial carrier will be obliged to get you a replacement onward-bound flight.  However, if you purchased the two tickets separately you should contact the second airline for assistance, but they would have no legal obligation to replace your original booking for free or give you a refund. After two hours, the airline should hand out food and drink vouchers to those in the airport waiting for their flights. For those stranded, the airline should provide hotel accommodation overnight.  Some holidaymakers may have to end up staying an extra night before flying home. Mr French says that that cost should also be covered by the airline, but it is important to keep the airline informed, in case they have a (cheaper) alternative. This cost may have to be claimed back afterwards. Sally Gethin, editor of Gethin's Inflight News, says that travellers should keep a record and receipts of all their extra spending. Abta says this obligation only applies if you are stranded within the EU or are travelling with an EU-based airline. So if you are stuck in New York with an America-based airline they would not have to cover these extra expenses. Someone who has booked a package holiday can get a refund for the whole holiday, if their flight is cancelled. This starts to become more difficult, but customers can still try to make a claim with their airline. Another option is to try to make a claim on their travel insurance. The Association of British Insurers says that policies will vary, so customers should look at the small print or contact their insurer to check.  Airlines will be required to transport you to the airports you were booked to and from. So, if an inbound flight is diverted to, say Manchester, then the airline should make travel arrangements to take you to Gatwick. Some train companies are offering to take passengers free of charge.  You are taking a risk. It is unlikely that an airline will cover the cost of a taxi where other more cost-effective options, such as trains or coaches, are available. Always discuss this with the airline first. You can try to make a claim but, even if successful, this would only cover the cost to the airport, not any extra journey to get you all the way home. Those who are unsuccessful could try claiming via their travel insurance. Again this is relevant if an inbound flight is delayed or diverted. Car parking providers may waive any extra costs, the airline may cover it, or drivers could try claiming on their travel insurance if the policy covers this type of consequential loss.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46530345", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Payal Kadakia, founder of fitness class booking website ClassPass. Could you come up with a strong idea for a business in just 14 days? That was the challenge Payal Kadakia set herself back in 2010, when the then 27-year-old wanted to quit the corporate world and set up her own venture. Working for record label giant Warner Music Group in New York at the time, she had been inspired to try to run her own company after a holiday to northern California. \"I had gone to San Francisco and met a lot of entrepreneurs,\" says Payal, now 35. \"I thought, 'what if I could come up with an idea?' So I gave myself two weeks.\" Fortunately for Payal, the lightbulb moment struck just 36 hours into the challenge she had set herself. An avid dancer and fitness enthusiast, she was struggling to book a ballet class back in New York. \"I visited six different websites, and I couldn't tell if the class was right for me,\" she says. \"An hour had gone by, and I'd still not booked anything.\" So there and then Payal came up with the idea of creating a website that would collate dance and fitness classes from across the city, and allow users to book them all from that one place. She would then charge the gyms and dance class providers a commission per booking. After six months of researching her business idea, she quit her day job in January 2011 to start work on the first iteration of ClassPass. Today the New York-based business is said to be worth $470m (\u00a3375m), and is available across the US, and in nine other countries including the UK, Canada and Australia. Meanwhile, Forbes magazine estimates that Payal - who was born and raised in New Jersey to parents who had emigrated from India - has a personal fortune of more than $50m.  It hasn't all been plain sailing for the business though, with Payal needing a number of attempts to find the best business model. Back in 2011 she gave herself two years to make a success of ClassPass, which was initially called Classtivity. \"I had two years to live off what I had saved,\" she says. Raising $500,000 from friends and family, Classtivity launched to the public in 2012 - and was initially a flop. Looking back she says that while there was a lot of buzz about the launch it didn't translate into enough sales. \"We had to take a hard look [at the business].\" What Payal decided to do in 2014 was to stop allowing users to book individual classes on an ad hoc basis, and instead switched ClassPass to a package-based model. Firstly it offered 20 classes a month for a set fee, but then lowered that to 10 when it realised that most people didn't have time to attend 20 classes a month. Today the packages are sold on a subscription basis, and instead of users being able to book a certain number of classes a month, they are now given between 25 and 100 credits instead. The gym owners and fitness class organisers are then paid a predetermined amount per ClassPass attendee. The more expensive or popular a certain class is, the more credits a ClassPass user has to redeem in order to join. For example, a near full yoga session might be nine credits, while a less busy box-fit class could only be four credits. More The Boss features: The fact that the business model has changed a number of times has not been without criticism, but Payal says that all the changes were necessary as the company tried to find a way of doing business that best worked financially. \"We never wanted to keep switching things up,\" she says. \"[But] we wouldn't be here if we hadn't changed.\" Despite the changes along the way, ClassPass has seen its popularity soar in recent years. The company now claims to have handled close to 60 million class reservations via its website and app, and it has 14,000 gyms, dance classes and other venues and businesses on its books. While the private company won't reveal its annual turnover, it has now secured more than $173m from outside investors including Google. Zameira Hersi, a leisure analyst at research group Mintel, says that the company's success is down to how convenient it is for people to use. \"By making it easy to find, book and pay for classes, ClassPass helps to remove some of the barriers to being active,\" she says. However, Ms Hersi adds that the firm's prices might put a limit on future growth, because \"many people may feel that they get more for their money if they stick with their current gyms\". To drive further expansion the company is now also enabling users to book things like facials, acupuncture and massages. And it hopes to move into photography and arts and crafts classes. Since last year, Payal's job title has been executive chairman, after she relinquished the chief executive role. Explaining the change, she says: \"I wanted to add value for the company, and for me that was freeing up my time to work on the things I wanted to do.\" Her remit now includes focusing on new products, branding and marketing. She also makes time to help run her own dance group, the Sa Dance Company, which focuses on traditional Indian dances. \"If I think about the number of hours people have put into classes [via ClassPass]... I feel grateful and privileged,\" she says.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46453516", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Rupert Hunt, founder of flat-sharing website SpareRoom. When Rupert Hunt set up a flat-sharing website he never guessed that he'd one day need to use the service himself. Rupert launched London-based SpareRoom back in 2004, aged 29, to try to offer people an easier way of finding or filling a room in a shared house. He very much expected that most of the users would be students, or people in their 20s. Then in 2013, aged 38, he separated from his wife, and found that he didn't like living on his own. So for the first time he signed up as a user of his own business. \"I was divorced and missed having company in the house,\" he says. Now 43, Rupert still has flatmates, and says he is far from alone in being a 40-something that lives in shared accommodation, as recent surveys have shown. \"The biggest growth area for co-living space is people in their 40s,\" he says. \"They are maybe coming out of relationships or marriages, and financially can't afford a place on their own. Or like me, they're bored of living on their own and want some company.\" Today SpareRoom is available in both the UK and the US, and claims that 11.5 million people view its website every month.  Not bad for a business that Rupert launched from a shed on his father's farm in the north of England.  Whizz back in time to the mid-1990s and Rupert had no intention of setting up any business. He was instead the bassist in a band all set for fame and fortune. Unfortunately this never arrived for the London-based group, which was called Erogenous Jones. So stacking shelves in his local supermarket, Rupert taught himself how to design websites in his spare time. Realising that finding rooms to rent in the capital was a miserable business of looking through free newspapers, or scouring notes put up in shop windows, in 1999 he came up with the idea for the earliest iteration of SpareRoom, a rentals listing website called IntoLondon. This started to earn him a few hundred pounds a month, which supplemented his new career as a website designer.  Moving to Manchester in 2002, he realised that finding a room to rent was equally as difficult there, so he started to give the website more love and attention.  Renaming it SpareRoom, it officially launched in 2004. Its business model is such that while it is free to use, people can choose to pay for advanced features, such as having their advert listed more prominently, or early bird messaging. With little or no money for advertising, Rupert needed a big idea to secure some publicity. Thankfully his first and at the time only employee Gemma Allen-Muncey had a cunning plan. Her idea was to hold a \"speed flatmating\" evening in a London pub. Using the same format as speed dating, people looking to rent a room would each have a few minutes to chat to someone who was looking for a new flatmate. \"We managed to convince the Wandsworth Guardian (local newspaper) to come down and cover it,\" says Rupert. \"Then all of a sudden we had the Times newspaper on the phone asking us about it. \"It ended up being a big international story, with TV crews and radio stations covering it.\" Today SpareRoom still holds regular speed flatmating evenings both across the UK and in the US. But back in 2004, little did the world's media know that Rupert and Gemma were operating out of a farm shed on the rural edge of Greater Manchester to keep costs down. \"Gemma and I shared it with multiple spiders. Trying to avoid them all day wasn't much fun,\" he says. As the business grew, Rupert and Gemma were thankfully able to swap the shed for an office in Manchester, with a London office following a few years later. Rupert says that it was in 2007 that the site really started to boom, and he had to hire additional developers to make sure that the website could cope. More The Boss features: In early 2016 he came up with the idea to publicise SpareRoom after buying a six-bedroom \u00a33m townhouse in the fashionable Spitalfields area of east London. Announcing that he was looking for flatmates who only need pay what they could afford, he got thousands of applicants, and lots of newspaper coverage.  He then repeated the trick later that year in New York when he hired a vast loft apartment in Manhattan as SpareRoom expanded to the US. Mark Homer, co-founder of UK property management advocacy group Progressive Property, says that SpareRoom has helped to improve the reputation and quality of shared renting. \"Modern shared accommodation has moved on significantly from the days of the rundown rent-a-room type affair of yesteryear,\" he says. With 80 employees, Rupert says that SpareRoom has an annual turnover of more than \u00a38.5m, and he is proud that the business has never needed any external investment. Gemma is still with the business too, running its Manchester office, while Rupert is based in London. Rupert, who has the chief executive title, is also continuing to enjoy having flatmates. \"Sharing with people adds randomness to your day: someone may have cooked, or someone may want to go for a pint,\" he says. \"It's nice to have that company, it feels like a surrogate family.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46361764", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Anne Wojcicki, founder of genetic testing business 23andMe. If you ever worry that you and your siblings are not achieving enough in life, Anne Wojcicki and her two sisters won't make you feel any better. Anne, 45, is the chief executive of Silicon Valley-based 23andMe, which is valued as high as $2.5bn (\u00a32bn), while Susan Wojcicki, 50, is the chief executive of YouTube. Third sister Janet Wojcicki, 48, is an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, where she helps lead efforts to tackle everything from obesity to HIV. Not bad genes in that family you would guess, but Anne says their individual achievements are down to a combination of luck and good parenting. \"We were lucky to be raised by great parents who exposed us both to communication - my mum is a journalist - and technology - my dad is a particle physicist,\" she says. She recalls that her parents taught them all to be free thinkers. \"I remember them telling me, 'Don't be afraid if someone disagrees with you.'\" But if Anne believes that her upbringing was a bigger contributor to her success in life than her genetic makeup, since 2006 she has been leading a company that tests people's genes - 23andMe. Named after the number of chromosomes in a normal human cell, the company allows members of the public to receive data about their ancestry, and - more controversially - gain information on their genetic health risks. They do this by posting off a 23andMe home saliva testing kit. After growing up on the campus of Stanford University, near San Francisco, where her father was a professor, Anne crossed the US to study at Yale University in Connecticut. After graduating with a biology degree in 1996 she moved back to California to work as a molecular biology researcher at the National Institutes of Health government agency, and then the University of California, San Diego. The idea for 23andMe came when she realised that the insurance-based US healthcare system did not put enough focus on preventing illnesses in the first place, or the poorest members of society. \"I started to see how financial incentives encouraged the healthcare system to not really care for the patients that needed their help the most,\" says Anne. After all, she adds, healthcare professionals \"don't make money by preaching prevention, and so I wanted to create something in the best interest of everyday people\". She says she was further motivated by the rise of Facebook, other forms of social media, and YouTube, which she says gave members of the public much more of a voice. So in 2006 she set up 23andMe with co-founders Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza. The test enabling people to find out more about their ancestry - such as where around the world a person's DNA comes from - was instantly popular, but the company has faced difficulty with its parallel health risks test service. Specifically, 23andMe struggled to get regulatory approval for its health tests, due to concerns about their accuracy. This led to a number of run-ins with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which in 2013 banned the company from marketing them. The FDA started to give approval for 23andMe's health checks from 2015, and it can now offer them on everything from risk of certain cancers, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and coeliac disease. \"That setback [in 2013] was a challenge to overcome, and I realised we were so focused on the work to instil in our staff about the long-term vision of the company that we didn't look down the path of providing the FDA with our clinical and analytical validity,\" says Anne. While the disputes with the FDA caused the company difficulties, it did not put off investors. Exact figures are hard to come by because 23andMe remains a private company, but according to estimates it has now raised just over $790m, giving it the $2.5bn valuation. An early investor was internet giant Google, which invested $3.9m in 2007. At the time Google co-founder Sergey Brin was married to Anne. They divorced in 2015. More than five million people across more than 50 countries are now said to have bought and used a 23andMe home data test. In addition to telling users about any potential genetic health risks, it aims to use the DNA data it collects - stripped of identifiers so as to keep everything anonymous - to help create new drugs and treatments. To help achieve this goal, the company signed a four-year research and collaboration agreement this July with UK drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline. Anne says that while the tests cannot perform miracles - she jokes that \"you won't know the day you are going to die\" - they can \"tell us about risk factors\". She adds: \"Our life expectancy is this beautiful interplay of what we're born with, and how we live. Our environment plays a major role in our health.\" Bradley Malin, professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, says that companies like 23andMe are now increasingly being taken more seriously. \"[Initially] the majority of the services provided focused on learning about one's traits and ancestral heritage,\" he says. \"Over time the focus has increasingly shifted towards kinship discovery and diagnostic services, which is shifting the dynamic, making these companies less of a novelty, and more of a technology that has the potential to be quite disruptive.\" On a day-to-day basis Anne says she likes to be a hands-on boss with her 500 employees. \"I like knowing not just about the work someone is doing, but about who they are.\" She adds that like her two sisters she is continuing to follow her passions. \"All three of us really enjoy our work, and feel like we are contributing to the world.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46293623", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Spencer Rascoff, chief executive of US property website Zillow. Going to a Rolling Stones concert has inspired generations of teenagers to pick up a guitar, but for Spencer Rascoff it was instead the catalyst for a life in business. As a teen, Spencer was lucky enough to go backstage at a number of the band's gigs in the early 1990s. But rather than marvelling at Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and the rest of the group, he says he was fixated on the teeming personnel running around to keep the entire show on the road. \"I saw the tour producer as the chief executive, and the band and the show was the product,\" says Spencer, now 43. \"That was a formative experience for me, I was fascinated by the business of music.\" Spencer was able to go backstage at the concerts because his dad Joseph was a business manager and tour producer for the Stones, and a host of other top acts including U2, David Bowie and Paul Simon. Yet while the experience made Spencer want to run a business, his dad advised him against going into the vagaries of the music industry. Today Spencer is the chief executive of US property listings website Zillow, which is worth about $3.9bn (\u00a33bn). The Seattle-based company has an annual turnover of more than $1bn, and says it is used by 195 million Americans every month who are looking to sell, buy or rent a home. Raised in New York and Los Angeles, Spencer went to Harvard University, where he graduated with a degree in government and economics. After two years working as an investment banker on Wall Street, aged 24 he co-founded his first business, travel website Hotwire.com, in 1999. The company grew quickly, but was then badly affected by the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Not only was Hotwire hit by the subsequent downturn in travel, it faced a public relations storm when the FBI discovered that some of the hijackers had used it to buy tickets. The tickets in question were not for the planes on the fateful day, but for flights a few days earlier, yet Hotwire faced difficult headlines. \"That kind of press, and the fact that people weren't flying much after 9/11 forced Hotwire to tighten the belt significantly, and that was tough to do,\" says Spencer, who was the company's vice president and who also lost a family friend in the terrorist attacks. As a result, Hotwire found itself in difficulty and had to lay off staff.  Spencer and his co-founders then saw much of their equity wiped out when the company was forced to lower the value of the business to attract vital new investment. The ultimate consequence of this was that when Hotwire was sold to rival Expedia for $663m in 2003 Spencer's proceeds from the sale \"were minimal\". After working for Expedia for a year, he left to join two former Expedia employees who had just launched a property website called Zillow. The aim was to list properties for sale across the US, but as Spencer admits, they weren't exactly sure how they were going to monetise it. \"When we began we had no business model,\" he says. \"We just wanted to build a huge audience and then figure out the model later.\" More The Boss features: To build up this audience Zillow allows anyone selling a home to list it for free on its website, be they members of the public, or a firm of estate agents. The website (and the app that followed) is also free for people to use when hunting for a home to buy or rent. So how exactly does Zillow make its money? Through advertising. Firstly, estate agents can pay for their properties to appear at the top of the search list in any given region. And secondly, other businesses in the wider housing sector can pay to place adverts, such as interior designers, or home improvement retailers. These retailers are attracted by Zillow's vast user numbers. To help secure these eyes on screen the company aims to list every single property in the US, not just those up for sale or rent. It does this by trawling through public records, such as lists of residential property tax values, and using photos from Google Street View. Currently Zillow claims to list the details of 110 million homes in the US (which includes homes for sale, for rent and those not currently on the market), out of the total 137.4 million that the US Census Bureau says are in the country. For each listed home, Zillow gives an estimated value or \"zestimate\". Saul Klein, editor of online news outlet Realty Times, says that Zillow's property values can sometimes cause problems. \"Many people use these as an authoritative source, forgetting it's just an estimate,\" says Mr Klein. \"And real estate agents get very frustrated with these figures because home owners would argue with them, saying this or that estimate is what the home is worth.\" Mr Klein adds that Zillow is operating in a very competitive marketplace. \"There are a lot of players out there, so how Zillow will stake up in five or 10 years from now is a question mark.\" Now expanding the business into Canada, Spencer has been chief executive since 2010. Since then the business has acquired 15 smaller rivals, and in 2011 floated on the New York Stock Exchange. The firm's most recent financial results showed that its turnover in the three months to the end of September was 22% higher than the same period a year earlier. This growth was, however, below market expectations and the company's shares have lost half their value since the summer on signs that the US housing market is slowing. While Spencer may not have followed his late father (Joseph Rascoff died last year) into looking after concert tours, he is often on the road. \"We have nearly 4,000 employees spread out in a dozen offices, and I travel frequently because I feel that it's important to spend time directly with employees,\" he says. \"A typical day on the road is 6am until 11pm, with email and social media squeezed in at the end of a long day.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46197270", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to serial Dutch entrepreneur Kees Koolen, whose latest company is battery manufacturer Lithium Werks. After Kees Koolen and his motorbike somersaulted down a rocky hillside in Western Sahara in 2006, the local ambulance crew said there was nothing they could do to save his life. \"They said I would die for sure,\" says Mr Koolen, looking back on the crash. \"So they didn't want to do anything.\" At the time the Dutch businessman was 41, and had taken time off from his job as chief operating officer at travel firm Booking.com to compete in a long-distance motorcycle race in north Africa. He was nearing the end of a day's riding when, overtaking a car and another motorbike, he didn't notice the sharp drop to the side of the road. Plunging down, he broke 22 bones, and suffered serious head trauma after his helmet cracked open. Thankfully for Mr Koolen, he had some friends with him, and they forced the ambulance crew to at least try to save his life. \"My friends got into a big fight with the ambulance men,\" he says. Mr Koolen was ultimately flown back to the Netherlands by private plane for emergency surgery, and a very slow recovery. \"Not only had I broken 22 bones, but I lost my memory,\" says the 53-year-old. \"I still don't remember anything from the next year of my life.\" In hospital for six months following the crash, Mr Koolen was eventually able to walk again and return to Booking.com. One of the company's earliest investors, he went on to be its chief executive from 2008 to 2011. More The Boss features: Then from 2012 he advised another company he had invested in - US taxi-hailing firm Uber - on its global rollout, while also looking after his investments in scores of other tech firms. And while most of us would never have gone motorcycle racing again after a crash like he had, Mr Koolen decided to up the ante and start competing on his bike in the annual Dakar Rally, which can be as long as 9,000km (6,000 miles) and mostly on unpaved roads. \"When I'm working, I do 20-hour days every day,\" he says. \"I can't stop, so taking three weeks off every year to compete in the Dakar forces me to switch off from work. \"And then I always make the best business decisions when I return to work because I'm fresh.\" Today Mr Koolen's main focus is his lithium-ion battery business Lithium Werks, which is based in the city of Hengelo, in the eastern Netherlands. Although the company was established only at the start of this year, after it bought existing US firm Valence and fellow Dutch business Super B, Lithium Werks already has two factories up and running in China, and another on the way. The rechargeable batteries are aimed at both electric vehicles - everything from taxis, to ships, forklift trucks and lorries - and for power storage at solar panel installations and wind farms. With global demand for such batteries predicted to grow by as much as 16 times current levels by 2030, as the world turns away from burning fossil fuels, Mr Koolen wants Lithium Werks to be one of the biggest suppliers. \"Turnover this year will be $80m (\u00a363m), and I predict close to $1bn next year, and then growing further from there,\" he says. \"Demand for batteries is going to be huge going forward.\" Born and raised on a small dairy farm in the south of Netherlands, beside the Belgian border, Mr Koolen says he didn't leave his village until he was 11. \"I also never spoke Dutch until I went to secondary school and had to learn it,\" he says. Until then he had only spoken the Brabantian dialect. After finishing school Mr Koolen studied mechanical engineering at a university in the city of Eindhoven. It was around this time that he started to compete in Ironman triathlons - a 2.4-mile (3.9km) swim, followed by a 112-mile (180km) bike ride, and then running a marathon. However, after his knee was injured in a car accident when a drunk driver ploughed into his car, he switched to motor sports. Mr Koolen then studied for an MBA (master of business administration qualification), before starting a successful career as a consultant, advising a host of companies that he also started to invest in. One of these was Booking.com, which was formed in the Netherlands in 1997, and last year had revenues of $12.7bn. Mr Koolen's investments over the years have made him a multimillionaire, with a Dutch newspaper estimating in 2013 that he had a personal fortune of \u20ac115m ($130m; \u00a3101m). But is he right to be so bullish about Lithium Werks and the global demand for lithium-ion batteries? \"Lithium-ion batteries are absolutely key in the move to electric vehicles, but they also allow us to realise the full potential of solar and wind power through cheap and easy energy storage,\" says Richard Anderson from technology think tank RethinkX. \"So there's no question demand for these batteries will rocket, but of course that doesn't mean that everyone producing lithium-ion batteries will be successful. \"This will be an incredibly competitive marketplace where a number of big, well-established companies such as Tesla and Panasonic already operate.\" No matter how busy Mr Koolen is with Lithium Werks his enthusiasm for competing in motor sport rally events is undimmed. He has now entered the Dakar Rally nine times, and is the only person to have completed the race in all four main categories - motorcycle, quad bike, car and truck. The risk of injury doesn't bother him, he says, even remembering the time in 2013 when he broke his back while training on his quad bike. \"I was about to go over a jump and the throttle got stuck,\" he says. \"I fell from the bike and broke four vertebrae. \"I believe in fate though. Everyone dies when it is their time.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46149737", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to James Hind, founder of UK car price comparison website Carwow. While unforeseen circumstances can completely change all our lives, it was the global financial crisis that sent James Hind down an entirely different path. In 2008 he was a 21-year-old intern working at a UK investment fund when the world of finance was hit by turmoil. \"I watched the industry collapse, it was just chaos,\" he says. \"I suddenly realised that people in the financial world didn't have any control, they were just riding a wave. Watching that I realised it wasn't for me.\" So having previously planned to have a long career in finance, James walked away. Not immediately knowing what else to do with his life, he remembered that he had once been given the job advice that you should \"do what you love\". As a big fan of cars, he decided to launch a website that collated car reviews, and then try to sell advertising on the pages. Today the business is London-based price comparison website Carwow, and in 2017 it had an annual turnover of \u00a315m. Not bad for a company that the Nottingham University graduate started in the loft of his parents' home on the Wirral peninsula in the north west of England, and one that initially found it impossible to secure any funding. After first going travelling for a year, James launched the initial iteration of Carwow in 2010, when it was called Carbuzz. With his girlfriend Alexandra Margolis on board as co-founder, she designed the website while he set about adding all the content. Over the next few years advertising revenues trickled in, before James realised that the operation could both be more useful to customers, and far more lucrative, if it changed its business model. So he reinvented the website into one where users could search for the best price for a new car. Mirroring the price comparison websites that have particularly changed the insurance industry, his idea was that people could enter the exact details of the make and model of car they wanted, not just the colour and engine-size, but the precise combination of optional extras. A list of prices offered by dealers across the UK would then be displayed on the screen.  \"I realised that many people hated buying a car, they went into it expecting to have a bad time,\" says James, now 31. \"And a big reason for this was because most of us hate haggling, and buying a new car has always been a very rare example of a time when you were expected to have to do this. \"My idea was to completely remove the need for people to haggle.\" More The Boss features: Bringing a technology savvy friend called David Santoro on board to build the new website, the new version of the company was launched in 2012. But while a number of car dealers across the UK were happy to give it a go, potential investors most certainly were not. \"In the early days we massively struggled to secure funding,\" says James. \"We contacted virtually every venture capital fund in London, and all either said no, or just ignored us. \"And I can understand why. We were young entrepreneurs with no track record, and we had very little proof at the time that the business was going to work.\" It took a year and a half of \"cold emailing\" potential investors before the company got its first investment. The name change from Carbuzz to Carwow happened in 2014 because, ambitious for global growth in the future, James discovered that the Carbuzz brand had already been taken in other countries. Carwow has grown steadily since then, thanks to word of mouth and a popular YouTube channel where employees review cars. James says that the videos get 17 million views every month. Last year the company made 55,000 sales via its website, accounting for 5% of private new car sales in the UK. It also now operates in Germany and France. More than 2,000 dealers across the UK pay an undisclosed fee to be listed on the site. James says that they all pay the same amount, whether they are selling luxury cars or budget vehicles. He says this level approach is vital because it means that Carwow is \"completely agnostic about what car people buy\". Meanwhile, total investment in the business has now reached \u00a345m. This means that James, who is chief executive, no longer has a majority stake, something he says he is fine with. \"You can either take no investment and never grow, or secure it and really gain traction.\" Alexandra, 31, who is now James' fianc\u00e9e and holds the creative director job title, also has shares in the business, as does David Santoro, 34, who is the chief technical officer. Motoring journalist Robin Roberts says that the likes of Carwow, and its rivals such as Coast2Coast Cars, are a welcome addition to the marketplace because they help to \"relieve the hassle\" of buying a new car. \"I don't know anyone who actually enjoys the process of buying a car after the initial thrill of viewing one or test-driving a model,\" he says. \"So turning the tables and having dealers competing for your business has to be welcomed.\" While James admits that he may one day decide to sell up, he says that is a very long way off. \"We feel that we have barely got started at Carwow, we have barely touched the surface. There is huge opportunity to grow the business.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45900404", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Samir Desai, founder of peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle. Friends often share money-making ideas over a few drinks in a pub, but it is not often that the scheme in question ends up creating a billion pound business. But that is ultimately what happened after Samir Desai first discussed his big vision with two old university mates when they met up for a few pints in a bar in central London in 2008. At the time the UK and the rest of the world were still mired in the maelstrom of the global financial crisis.  As a result, banks had stopped lending to small businesses. The situation looked hopeless for small firms, but Samir - then a 26-year-old management consultant - had come up with what he thought was a good idea. He wanted to remove the banks from the equation, and instead allow the companies to more easily borrow funds from elsewhere. Specifically he wanted to create an online marketplace where small firms could apply to borrow money from a pool of funds supplied by individuals and other businesses - peer-to-peer lending. Samir's friends from his Oxford University days - James Meekings and Andrew Mullinger - both agreed that it was potentially a great idea for a business, so the three of them decided to research its feasibility. In 2009 they quit their jobs and started work on Funding Circle, which then launched in 2010. Earlier this month, the company became the first lender of its type to float on the London Stock Exchange, and is now valued at more than \u00a31.3bn. An impressive figure, albeit down from its initial listing price of \u00a31.5bn with analysts saying the flotation may have overpriced the firm. Samir, now 35, says he came up with the idea for the company because even before the financial crisis \"small business lending was pretty broken\". \"It took 15 to 20 weeks to get a loan [from a bank],\" he says. \"And I came to realise that actually only a very small part of what a bank does is small business lending - it [can be as low as] only 5%. \"But small businesses are quite a big deal to society - they employ 60% of the private-sector workforce, so there's a big disconnect on how much banks care about lending, and how much society cares.\" To get London-based Funding Circle up and running, the three friends put \u00a360,000 of their combined savings into the business. James had also previously been a management consultant, while Andrew had worked in risk management. The three friends also raised \u00a3700,000 from a dozen investors, including friends, and friends of friends. The funds enabled them to build the technology platform behind the website, and to then market and launch the business. However, persuading both the lenders and small firms to come on board proved complex. \"It was interesting in the early days,\" says Samir. \"It was like the chicken and the egg - which comes first, the business or the investor?\" To attract early investors the company offered them a \"cashback\" deal, whereby if the money they were lending via the website was due to pay them 7% interest, Funding Circle  would increase this to 9%, and pay the investors the other 2% from its own funds. To gain small business customers, Samir and his co-founders would send out letters. So much so that he says they ended up breaking the printer they had borrowed from James's dad. User numbers on both sides then started to slowly grow, and in 2011 Funding Circle secured \u00a32.5m in venture capital funding. This then rose to \u00a3250m, prior to this month's flotation. More than 50,000 small businesses and 80,000 investors have now used the company, which expanded to the US in 2013, and Germany and the Netherlands two years later. The business makes its money by charging the borrowers a fee of between 1% and 7% per loan, plus a 1% annual servicing fee. It hasn't made a profit yet though, but Samir says that this is deliberate, because the company has been investing heavily in expansion. \"The business continues to grow rapidly,\" he says. \"From our perspective we want to be the first choice for small businesses globally.\" Last week, the firm announced that loans arranged via Funding Circle totalled \u00a32.8bn as of 30 September, up 61% from the same date last year.  The company did not, however, unveil any new turnover or profit and loss figures. Instead, the most recently available show that it had annual revenues of \u00a394.5m in 2017, up from \u00a350.9m in 2016. Meanwhile, the pre-tax losses in 2017 totalled \u00a336.3m, compared with \u00a347.2m a year earlier. The company's share price also remains below the level at which it floated on 3 October. More The Boss features: Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, says that Funding Circle is likely to face challenges in the future. \"The peer-to-peer lending sector is relatively new and few companies within it have been through a severe economic downturn, which means there is a higher level of uncertainty about how these businesses will fare in difficult market conditions. \"The risk is that in a poor economic environment borrowers default on their loans in large numbers, and this will put the credit and risk mitigation methods within lending platforms to the test.\" Meanwhile, the BBC's business editor Simon Jack has questioned whether Funding Circle and its rivals could be harmed by a proposed regulatory tightening of the peer-to-peer lending sector in the UK.  The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is considering rule changes that would only allow very wealthy personal investors to use Funding Circle and its rivals in the future. The FCA's concern is that an investor's capital is potentially at risk. Samir, who has the chief executive job title, remains confident, however, in the continuing growth of the business. \"We're getting more and more repeat customers,\" he says. \"Investors are quite excited about the market size growth rates, high margins, and the scale of repeat customers.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45787962", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Charlie MacGregor, founder of student accommodation group The Student Hotel. Scot Charlie MacGregor says he will never forget watching the boats full of desperate refugees and illegal migrants trying to come ashore on the Greek island of Lesbos. \"Some boats didn't know where they were going, so would end up on the rocks,\" says the 42-year-old. \"Some [of those onboard] didn't even make it. \"The lucky ones that did were often terrorised, not only by the journey, but [fearing] what would happen to them next.\" This was in October 2015, when more than 2,000 people in unauthorised boats were arriving on Lesbos every single day, most of them Syrians escaping civil war. Charlie was a volunteer on the beaches, helping to direct the boats safely ashore, and then offer the men, women and children water, food and other assistance. He had been moved to fly to Lesbos to help after a friend had posted on Facebook about the situation just a few weeks earlier. \"As a dad with two kids my heart really went out to these families that were trying to get to the island,\" he says. \"There were young kids, women, all traumatised after fleeing war-torn countries.\" In going to Lesbos Charlie had taken time off from his day job as founder and boss of student accommodation company The Student Hotel (TSH). Today the Scottish businessman balances his time running TSH with helping to lead the charity he co-founded in 2016, Movement On The Ground. The charity helps refugees \"from the moment they arrive in Europe, until they're safe and sound in their new home country\". Born and raised in Edinburgh, Charlie says that \"student accommodation is in his blood\". His father had built student homes for the University of Edinburgh in the 1980s, and Charlie started his career working on those building sites at the tender age of 16. A few years later he used two loans - one from a bank, and one from his dad - to launch his own student accommodation company in Scotland. More The Boss features: Then in 2003, aged 27, he decided he wanted to live abroad. So he sold up, repaid the loans and moved to Amsterdam to launch TSH. The idea for the business was a pan-European chain of fashionable student accommodation buildings that are also hotels open to members of the public. So while most occupants would be students on long-term lets, business travellers or holidaymakers could rent rooms by the night. And there would be onsite restaurants, bars and gyms. Charlie was convinced that the idea would work, but others were less than enthusiastic. \"When I first thought of the concept I was literally laughed out of a meeting when I presented my idea to a room full of developers,\" he says. Undeterred, Charlie kept pitching his plans, and eventually a bank decided to back him. The first Student Hotel opened in Rotterdam in 2006, with other Dutch sites following. Then the global financial crisis hit in 2008, and the business ran into trouble. \"Six times I gave the keys to the company back to the bank,\" says Charlie. \"The saving grace was that there was also no-one else in the market who would, or could, buy the buildings, so even though the bank tried to sell them, they couldn't.\" As a result the bank kept allowing Charlie another go at running the business, and eventually he was able to ride out the storm. Today TSH has 11 sites across Europe, from Barcelona to Dresden, and another 12 in development, from Lisbon to Rome.  Locations in the UK are also now being explored. Two years ago Dutch pension fund ABP invested \u20ac100m ($115m; \u00a387m) in the business, and TSH says its annual turnover is now due to surpass \u20ac75m. Architect Andrei Martin, a partner at UK firm PLP Architecture, says that TSH is helping to lead \"an exciting development\" in student housing, making it of a higher, more appealing standard. \"Operators like The Student Hotel, who cater to a predominantly - although not exclusively - young demographic are radically reshaping our expectations of student housing,\" he says. But if running TSH was not enough work for Charlie, he spends part of each working day helping to look after things at Movement On The Ground, and visits Lesbos four or five times a year to help out personally. Initially Charlie and the four other co-founders funded the charity themselves, but it now relies on outside donations. Work the charity has so far done in the refugee and migrant camps on the island includes working with the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders to introduce toilet and shower facilities, and weatherproof tents. It has also started a football programme for children, and set up digital learning labs, so that the refugees and migrants can use the internet, learn to touch type and to code. \"Football is a great way of bringing people together,\" says Charlie.  \"And if people can leave the camp with a qualification for typing or coding, it would give them better opportunities.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45979780", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Peter Reinhardt, co-founder and chief executive of customer data infrastructure firm Segment. It takes a certain kind of courage, and honesty, to admit when you are wrong. Peter Reinhardt will quite cheerfully admit that at one point he was determined to kill the idea behind his now rapidly expanding and very successful business. He had tried two business ideas before with the firm he had co-founded with three friends. Both ideas had failed. He and his friends had wanted to identify and solve a problem facing organisations. The first idea, Classmetric, was \"a total disaster\", he says.  An online tool designed to give professors an insight into how well students were understanding lectures, it fell at the first hurdle, as rather than using the tool, students \"went straight to Facebook\". But while developing the failed ideas, the co-founders - Peter, Calvin French-Owen, Ilya Volodarsky and Ian Storm Taylor, who has since left the firm - wrote a small piece of computer code that was to become the basis of the successful company, Segment. The code acted as a pipeline connecting customer data from different websites. \"We'd built it for ourselves to solve our own data pipeline problems,\" says Peter. In December 2012 the other three founders wanted to use that small piece of code as the basis of a business model. Peter definitely did not. \"I was like, 'That is the worst idea I have ever heard,'\" he says. \"And so we fought about it, the four of us, all day long.\" The problem, as he saw it, was that this simple code was open source - that is, it had already been made available to developers at no cost - so Peter could not see how it could bring money in. He went home and hatched a plan that he thought would see the idea off once and for all. The plan was to build \"a really beautiful website\" that explained what the code did, offering a product based on the code which hadn't yet been built. \"We'll put it up in the developer community and we'll see what happens,\" he says, convinced that there wouldn't be any interest. \"And I was thinking to myself: 'This will kill it. For sure.'\" He was wrong. Within 24 hours of the website going up, the firm was bombarded with thousands of email enquiries about the product, which hadn't actually been built. \"A few hours into it we were like, 'Wow, OK, this is really a thing.' And so by the end of the day it was very obvious that we actually needed to build the product.\" After five days of little to no sleep, the team had the first version. Although the source code was freely available, the company built a hosted version, selling the product as a service. \"It was a massive adrenaline rush,\" he says. Segment is popular because it lets companies untangle customer data coming from different pieces of analytics and metrics software, as well as data about what and how customers are buying, Peter says. \"You can think of us like the plumbing of a company's customer data,\" he says. Less than a month after first offering the product, the team had 70 companies using it. It was tough to begin with, but Peter says he had a \"slightly odd\" way of dealing with it. \"When I had a particularly intense day, I wrote an email to myself, and I would send it for follow-up two years or four years down the road. \"When you read it [years later], it's like, 'Wow, that's not the rose-coloured memory I had of that time.'\" In October 2018, about 19,000 companies were using Segment, from start-ups to big players such as IBM, Levi's and 21st Century Fox. But at the beginning, the founders were \"really scared of asking people for money\", Peter says. \"We were coming from a culture that was not about paying for software. We originally were charging $120 per year, and found that many customers were happy to pay $120,000 per year,\" Peter says. While the private firm is cagey about how much money it brings in, Forbes estimates its 2017 revenue as $45m (\u00a335m). Brandon Purcell, analyst at market research firm Forrester, says Segment has seen such rapid growth because it addresses a big problem - \"messy data stored in disparate systems\". He says the firm faces competition on two fronts - from other customer data companies, and from big players such as Salesforce and Oracle, and also from Adobe, Microsoft, and SAP from a different direction. While Segment \"stands out\" due to the flexibility of what it can do, \"they're facing off against some behemoths with enormous existing customer bases, so they still face an uphill battle,\" Mr Purcell says. However, Peter insists that Segment is doing something quite unique, and eventually he wants the firm to go public. He says that as a boss he is \"learning very rapidly\" and he tries to learn \"superpowers\" from other members of the executive team. More The Boss features: In common with other Silicon Valley tech firms, Segment is quite egalitarian, he adds. \"I really want to hear what everyone has to say, and really make sure everyone has a voice, make sure we're bringing problems out on to the table and working out how to solve them. \"It's similar to our approach to customers.\" And it's an approach that seems to be working so far.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45706509", "content": " The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Stan Boland, founder and chief executive of UK driverless car company Five AI. As firms around the world race to develop self-driving cars, Stan Boland is betting that British brain power can beat American and Chinese cash. A veteran technology entrepreneur, the 58-year-old launched Five AI in 2016. Since then it has been moving as quickly as possible to design a driverless car that - the hope is - will at some point in the future gain regulatory approval to take to the roads without someone being behind the wheel as a human failsafe. The problem is that, compared with US giants Google, Uber and Tesla, Five AI is a tiny start-up company with only a fraction of the funding that its rivals' driverless car projects are receiving. Google, for example, spent at least $1.1bn on developing self-driving vehicles between 2009 and 2015. By contrast, Five AI has so far received investment of only \u00a329m ($38m). And when it comes to number of employees, Google's autonomous vehicle business Waymo is estimated to have some 3,500, and Uber's self-driving arm is said to have about 2,000. While both of these declined to share exact staff numbers, Five AI's workforce currently totals just 120 people. To the casual observer, Mr Boland and his team cannot hope to compete with his American rivals, nor the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent by Chinese group Baidu, and carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and BMW. Mr Boland freely admits that his project is \"a gamble\", and that \"a number of bets have got to come off for it to work\", but there is no doubting his ambition. \"We are building a company that I actually think will be worth tens of billions, if not more, but it is going to take a lot of focused effort to get there,\" he says. At this point many people may scoff, but with Five AI technicians now testing its adapted Ford Mondeos on the streets of south London, Mr Boland's back story suggests he should be taken seriously. A physics graduate from Cambridge University, he is a multi-millionaire who has grown and sold two British technology companies for a combined value of more than $1bn. The first was Element 14, a digital data transfer business. He was chief executive of the company in January 1999 when it was spun out from former owner Acorn Computers. Just 18 months later Mr Boland organised the sale of Element 14 to US group Broadcom for $640m. Then in 2002 he set up semi-conductor firm Icera, which he sold in 2011 to US company Nvidia for $367m. Mr Boland, who went to a grammar school in Manchester, has also been a director of UK semi-conductor group ARM Holdings. While he admits that Five AI is going to need more investment to fully develop its vehicles, he says it can do it more cheaply than its rivals, because it doesn't need to employ the vast number of supplementary staff that they do. \"There is always a team of 20 to 50 people [at any driverless car company] that is really driving the technology,\" he says. \"That is what it comes down to. \"So while Google's Waymo has [an estimated] 3,500 people, and Uber a couple of thousand, it really all comes down to just a handful of individuals. \"And the talent in computer vision and machine learning here in Europe is as strong as in the US.\" Based across six offices in the UK - London, Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford and at a testing track in Bedfordshire - Five AI also works closely with computer vision and artificial intelligence teams at the UK's top universities, and the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's leading AI research centre. Mr Boland says that he wants all of his staff to \"feel ownership of the company\", so all are given shares in the business. This is a policy he has insisted on throughout his career, as he believes it makes employees more committed, more hardworking. Back when he sold Element 14 it meant that most staff became millionaires overnight. \"The least anyone made from the sale was a part-time secretary, and she received \u00a3250,000.\" The business model for Five AI is not that its cars will be available for consumers to buy. Instead it plans to offer a shared taxi service. Its test cars are fitted with 14 cameras, six radars, three light radars, and computers that make 300 trillion calculators per second. The aim is to start offering a commercial service in London by 2022, albeit with a company employee in the driving seat just in case. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The hope is to go fully driverless at some point after that if the technology and regulators allow. And beat the likes of Waymo and Uber to market domination, at least in Europe. \"It is a massive ask from where we are today, but I do think that in the next three or four years we are going to get to a level where the cars are equal to human levels of safety,\" says Mr Boland. \"And then we want to improve from there.\" But will enough members of the public ever be willing to step into a driverless taxi? UK motoring journalist Robin Roberts isn't sure. \"I think that most people would not feel that confident,\" he says. \"Humans are able to react very quickly to their surroundings, and unforeseen events that happen on the roads. I don't think that a programmed computer could ever do the same as safely. \"There is no substitute for human reason in situations where split-second decisions have to be made.\" However, Mr Boland is confident. \"We are going to transform the way our cities operate. It is going to be a massive revolution.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45246999", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Ben Francis, founder of UK sportswear brand Gymshark. It is hard to know how a then 19-year-old Ben Francis had the time or the energy to get Gymshark up and running. While many young entrepreneurs have to juggle running their start-up with holding down a nine to five job, back in 2012 Ben was a full-time student by day, and a pizza delivery man by night. \"I'd wake up and go to Aston University [in Birmingham], then finish uni early afternoon, and work at Pizza Hut from 5pm till 10pm,\" he says. \"I could answer emails [about Gymshark] in between deliveries. Then I'd go home and sort out the website, and design new products.\" After two exhausting years of this - with annual revenues of his nascent business hitting an impressive \u00a3250,000 - Ben quit both university and the world of pizzas to focus on his company. Fast-forward to today, and Gymshark expects turnover this year to reach \u00a3100m.  Before Ben set up the business in 2012 it is fair to say that the entrepreneurial fire was already burning in his belly. As a young teenager he set up a website that sold car licence plates. A keen gym-goer, he then built and launched two iPhone fitness tracking apps, one of which earned him around \u00a38,000. The idea for Gymshark followed; an online retail business aimed at fitness fanatics that originally sold health supplements. \"I was going to the gym and basically was interested in, and wanted to be involved in, the fitness industry,\" he says. \"I wanted to combine that with making a transactional website.\" When Ben found that the profit margins from selling the supplements were too low, he dived into another area - clothing. \"I remember looking around, and I couldn't find any clothing I wanted to wear,\" he says. \"So I said, 'let's make it ourselves.'\" Enlisting the help of his brother, and a group of friends, Ben bought a sewing machine and screen printer, and started to make gym vests and t-shirts in his parents' garage. \"My nan made curtains, so she taught me how to sew,\" he says. \"I remember thinking we had 10 orders to do, and to make 12-15 products it would take most of the day. But it was so much fun learning.\" Now 26, Ben admits that after Gymshark first moved into clothing there was no immediate grand plan regarding growing the business. \"It was more a case of 'I really want to wear this,' so I made it,\" he says. And so the company started to make body builder vests that fitted slim teenagers, because most on the market were designed for older men who had already built up their muscle bulk. Ben adds that he would also guess on how much to price items. \"It was literally a case of what would we want to pay for something,\" he says. \"There was no considered approach. We were like, 'we would pay \u00a320.'\" Six years later, Gymshark now has more than 1.2 million customers, and 215 employees at its Solihull headquarters in the West Midlands. So how has the firm been able to grow so quickly? In short, it has been a very savvy user of social media. More specifically Gymshark decided it would send free clothing to key \"influencers\", prominent body-builders and other fitness fanatics - such as Lex Griffin and Nikki Blackketter. The hope was that such stars would talk positively about the products to their followers on YouTube and Instagram. The idea worked better than Gymshark could have dreamed, and sales soon skyrocketed. At the same time it worked hard to ensure its own social media accounts were as interesting and visual as possible. Today it has 2.4 million followers on Instagram and 1.5 million on Facebook. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: More recently the firm has held events around the world, inviting fans of the brand to meet some of its influencers. Hundreds of people typically attend. Another key factor in the continuing success of Gymshark is bringing in a more experienced pair of hands to help Ben run the business. Sportswear industry veteran Steve Hewitt joined as managing director in 2015, before being given the chief executive title in April last year. Ben remains the majority owner, with Mr Hewitt and chief strategic officer Paul Richardson also having substantial stakes. Another shareholder is Ben's friend Lewis Morgan who helped to launch Gymshark, but left the business a few years ago. Emily Sutherland, a features writer at trade magazine Drapers, says Gymshark's use of social media influencers has been key to its success. \"The influencers give shoppers a reason to buy into Gymshark over other brands, because they feel a personal connection,\" she says. Ms Sutherland adds that because Gymshark is an online-only and direct-to-consumer brand, it is \"able to remain nimble, react quickly to market changes, and isn't weighed down by expensive store costs\". As for the future, the plan is to expand Gymshark's overseas sales. Already 40% of its sales come from the US, and it aims to have 25 international country-specific online stores by 2020, up from 11 at present. The company may also open its first bricks-and-mortar store. \"I don't go shopping very often, but I'm thinking of the best way to do a permanent location somewhere,\" says Ben. \"I'm not sure, we'd need a lot of space. I want to do a cool destination.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45547352", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, founder of Indian pharmaceutical company Biocon. When Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw wanted to get a job at a brewery, they all said \"no\" because she was a woman. This was back in 1978, when the then 25-year-old had returned to her homeland of India with a master's degree in brewing from a university in Australia. Despite having this qualification every Indian beer company that she contacted \"said it was not going to be possible\" to take her on. \"They admitted that hiring a woman as a brewer was something they would not be comfortable with,\" says Ms Mazumdar-Shaw, now 65. While the situation was obviously very unfair, you could say it was fate that pulled her away from the brewing industry. Unable to get work as a brewer in India, she instead founded pharmaceutical business Biocon. Today this company is worth more than 400bn rupees ($5.6bn; \u00a34.3bn), and Ms Mazumdar-Shaw's personal wealth is estimated at $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn). This makes her India's only self-made female billionaire. Born and brought up in a middle class family in Bangalore, she gained a degree in zoology from the city's namesake university, before going to Australia to study brewing. When no Indian brewer would then employ her she decided to look overseas instead. And so she was due to start a job at a brewery in Scotland, when she had a chance meeting with an Irish entrepreneur called Leslie Auchincloss. He was keen to set up a pharmaceutical business in India, and he was so impressed by Ms Mazumdar-Shaw that he asked her to be his partner and lead the business. Ms Mazumdar-Shaw initially turned him down. \"I told him, I am the last person he should ask because I had no business experience, and I had no money to invest,\" she says. But Mr Auchincloss ultimately persuaded her to give it a shot, and Biocon was born in 1978.  Ms Mazumdar-Shaw started the business out of a garage, investing her life savings of $150. And again her gender continued to be a stumbling block, as no-one was willing to work for a woman. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: \"It was not just men, even women were not willing to work for another woman,\" she says.  \"They would walk into the garage and see me. They would assume I am the secretary.\" After seeing 40 candidates she was finally able to hire her first employee - a retired garage mechanic. Raising capital was the other big challenge - as banks were not willing to give her a loan to start the business. \"I was only 25 years old, so the banks felt that I was a girl trying to run a business which nobody understood, I was really high risk in every sense of the word,\" she says. Finally one banker agreed to give her a loan in 1979. Biocon started out manufacturing enzymes used in the production of alcoholic drinks, paper and other products. Most of its clients were based in the US and Europe. For the brewing industry it made an enzyme from papaya fruit that prevented beers from being hazy. By the beginning of this century the company had started focusing on producing biopharmaceuticals, which are medicines that are made from a biological source. This proved increasingly lucrative, and in 2004, Biocon became only the second Indian company to cross the one-billion-dollar mark on the day it floated on the National Stock Exchange of India. \"That was a huge eureka moment for me because we knew we were very different, but we hadn't really ever visited the value creation that had happened along the way,\" says Ms Mazumdar-Shaw. who holds the title of chairperson. For its most recent financial year, the company's revenues were $172m, and its profits totalled $18m. Now operating in more than 100 countries, some 68% of its income comes from international markets. Its key products include a range of insulin drugs. \"Kiran has been very disciplined about focusing on biopharmaceuticals,\" says Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at financial services group India Infoline. He adds that if Biocon's latest drugs get regulatory approval in more countries, then the company could see profits \"rise four to five times by 2021\". Looking forward Ms Mazumdar-Shaw, who owns 40% of Biocon's shares, says she wants to take on the large Western pharmaceutical companies. \"I want to challenge the big boys,\" she says. Her success in business has seen her win numerous awards in India, including the Padma Bhushan, one of the country's highest civilian honours. Looking at the wider Indian business community, she says that she is \"very disappointed\" that there aren't other self-made female billionaires. However, Ms Mazumdar-Shaw is optimistic that things are changing. 'I hope in the next 10 years a lot more self-made women billionaires will emerge,\" she says. \"At this point in time, I don't mind even if they're not self-made. I just want more women playing more leadership roles in business.\" To help do her bit Ms Mazumdar-Shaw, also mentors a lot of up and coming entrepreneurs, both male and female. She says her advice to them is that \"failure is temporary, but giving up is final\". \"So don't fear failure. Endure and make sure you get to the finishing line.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45330897", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to US entrepreneur and basketball team owner Mark Cuban. Self-made billionaire Mark Cuban says he always dreamed of getting rich. \"My priority was to be wealthy,\" says the 60-year-old owner of the Dallas Mavericks. \"If I could get rich I could retire, and it would be easier to find the right person and start a family.\" Born and raised in a working class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Mr Cuban achieved his financial dream at the age of 32. That was back in 1990, when he sold his then computer business MicroSolutions for $6m (\u00a34.6m). Sticking to his life plan, he promptly retired, and travelled the world. However, Mr Cuban ultimately missed working life, and in 1995 he co-founded audio and video streaming website Broadcast.com. Four years later this was sold to Yahoo for $5.7bn, making Mr Cuban a billionaire at the age of 41. Today his main focus is his sometimes controversial ownership of the Mavericks. He also has numerous other business commitments and investments, and a high profile role as one of the investors on the Shark Tank TV show, the US version of the UK's Dragons' Den. Now worth an estimated $3.9bn, he puts his success in life and business down to both working hard - and working strategically. \"Everyone has the will to win,\" he says. \"[But] only those with the will to prepare, do win.\" Mr Cuban's earliest entrepreneurial pursuit was selling rubbish bags door-to-door at the tender age of 12, so he could raise the funds to buy an expensive pair of basketball shoes. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: Then at university in Pittsburgh and Bloomington, Indiana, he ran a bar, held dancing lessons and promoted parties. He says the jobs taught him that \"happy customers lead to great results\", and that \"running a business is a lot of work, but can be very rewarding\". After graduating with a degree in management, Mr Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas, where he got a job as a salesman for a software firm. The impetus for starting his own business in the sector came in 1983, when he was sacked on the spot for securing a five-figure deal without authorisation. A few months later he set up MicroSolutions, which he grew for the next seven years, before its sale. Broadcast.com then followed. After the sale of Broadcast.com in 1999, Mr Cuban is reported to have immediately gone out and bought a private jet for $40m. A year later he purchased a majority stake in the Mavericks for $280m. Meanwhile, Yahoo made a hash of Broadcast.com. The website was quickly ignored, and Broadcast.com was quietly discontinued after 2002. With Mr Cuban at the helm the Mavericks won their first National Basketball Association (NBA) championship in 2011. Today the team have annual revenues of $233m, and Forbes magazine values the franchise at $1.9bn, the ninth richest in the 30-team NBA. Mr Cuban has also introduced some extra razzmatazz to the Mavericks in the shape of a male hip hop dance troupe called Mavs ManiAACs that since 2002 has been entertaining fans at home games. \"Prior to me buying the Mavs, NBA teams thought that they were in the basketball business,\" he says. \"I knew we were in the experience business. \"Fans come to have fun and unique experiences they couldn't get anywhere else. The Mavs ManiACCs upset a lot of traditionalists.\" Sports industry expert Richard Barker says that Mr Cuban is a successful risk taker in business. Mr Barker, who is executive vice president of sports PR agency M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, says that buying the Mavericks in 2000, then an \"ailing\" team, was a \"big risk\". \"Cuban saw what many now know to be true - the commercial power of a major league as an entertainment force, not just something for the core fans,\" he says. \"In 2018 the NBA is the most relevant [US sport] to youth culture, and it is the league that others are chasing. Cuban is a big part of that evolution.\" Mr Cuban's ownership is not without controversy though. If the dance troupe wasn't bad enough for some, he has been fined numerous times for criticising officials. On one occasion back in 2001 he said that the then NBA's head of refereeing was not fit to even be a store manager at US ice cream chain Dairy Queen. The statement prompted an aggrieved Dairy Queen to invite Mr Cuban to go and work in one of its branches for the day, which he did. In addition to the basketball team Mr Cuban's other business interests and investments include being co-owner of media group 2929 Entertainment, and chairman of US cable and satellite TV firm AXS. He also writes business how-to books. Looking back on his earlier self, Mr Cuban says that his inspiration was Ted Turner, the founder of news TV channel CNN. \"Turner did it his way, and didn't care what anyone said about him,\" he says. \"He worked hard, and played hard. Traits I admire.\" A married father of three, Mr Cuban's advice to young people who want to start their own company is to focus on something you are interested in. \"The key to success is finding something you like to do, and becoming really good at it,\" he says. And in addition to solid preparation work, he says that a good entrepreneur has to have perseverance. \"It doesn't matter how many times you fail, you only have to be right once.\"", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25119436", "content": "Dame June Whitfield was a constant presence in British post-war comedy.

It emerged this week that tech companies have been racing to fix the Meltdown and Spectre bugs, that could allow hackers to steal data. Billions of PCs, smartphones and tablets around the world are affected - Apple has now confirmed its products are too. The firm has released some patches to mitigate the Meltdown flaw. It said there was no evidence that either vulnerability had been exploited yet, but advised downloading software only from trusted sources to avoid \"malicious\" apps.   Mac users have often believed that their devices and operating systems are less vulnerable to security issues than, for example Android phones or computers running Microsoft systems.  The Meltdown and Spectre flaws are found in many modern computer processing units - or microchips - designed by Intel and ARM, and together the firms supply almost the entire global computer market. \"All Mac systems and iOS devices are affected, but there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time,\" Apple said in blog post on the issue. \"These issues apply to all modern processors and affect nearly all computing devices and operating systems.\"  Apple said it had already released \"mitigations\" against Meltdown in its latest iPhones and iPad operating system update - iOS 11.2  and the macOS 10.13.2 for its MacBooks and iMacs.  Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch, it said. Patches against Spectre, in the form of an update to web browser Safari, will be released \"in the coming days\". Google and Microsoft have already issued statements telling users which products are affected by the bugs. Google said its Android phones - which make up more than 80% of the global market - were protected if users had the latest security updates. And Microsoft has already released fixes for many of its services.  Windows users should be aware that third-party anti-virus software may need to be updated before applying operating system patches. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont is maintaining an online list of anti-virus products that have been updated. Guidance from US cyber-security project CERT, which is funded by the federal government, originally advised computer users that in order to fully remove the vulnerability they would have to \"replace\" processor hardware.

San Francisco-based Gfycat has said it thinks the clips are \"objectionable\". The creation of such videos has become more common after the release of a free tool earlier this month that made the process relatively simple. The developer says FakeApp has been downloaded more than 100,000 times. It works by using a machine-learning algorithm to create a computer-generated version of the subject's face.  To do this it requires several hundred photos of the celebrity in question for analysis and a video clip of the person whose features are to be replaced. The results - known as deepfakes - differ in quality. But in some cases, where the two people involved are of a similar build, they can be quite convincing. Some people have used the technology to create non-pornographic content. These include a video in which the face of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has been replaced with that of US President Donald Trump, and several in which one movie star's features have been swapped with those of another. End of Youtube post  by derpfakes But the most common use of the tool has apparently been to reversion pornography to feature popular female actresses and singers. Many of these clips have subsequently been shared online and critiqued by others. Many creators uploaded their clips to Gfycat. The service is commonly used to host short videos that are then posted to social website Reddit and elsewhere. Gfycat allows adult content, but began deleting some of the deepfakes earlier this week, a matter that was first reported by the news site Motherboard. \"Our terms of service allow us to remove content that we find objectionable. We are actively removing this content,\" Gfycat said in a brief statement. Reddit has yet to comment on the matter. It still provides access to clips that Gfycat has yet to delete, as well as deepfakes hosted by others. Its content policy prohibits \"involuntary pornography\".  But it is not clear whether it would recognise the deepfakes as such. Moreover, it requires the subject involved to make a complaint. However, Gfycat is not the only party to have forced some of the material offline. The owner to the rights of some of the explicit content has demanded that clips be blocked on copyright grounds. In addition, the chat service Discord closed down a group dedicated to sharing the clips, saying that they had violated its rules on non-consensual pornography.

The company is accused of using the personal data of 50 million Facebook members to influence the US presidential election in 2016. Its executives have also been filmed by Channel 4 News suggesting it could use honey traps and potentially bribery to discredit politicians. The company denies any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned to give evidence about the company's links to Cambridge Analytica to a UK parliamentary committee. Damian Collins MP, who is leading the committee's inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of giving answers \"misleading to the committee\" at a previous hearing which asked whether information had been taken without users' consent. On Monday, Channel 4 News broadcast hidden camera footage in which Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix appears to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.  In the footage, asked what \"deep digging\" could be done, Mr Nix told an undercover reporter: \"Oh, we do a lot more than that.\" He suggested one way to target an individual was to \"offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that's video recorded\". He also said he could \"send some girls around to the candidate's house...\" adding that Ukrainian girls \"are very beautiful, I find that works very well\". Mr Nix continued: \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done.\" Channel 4 News said its reporter had posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get a political candidate elected in Sri Lanka. However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had \"grossly misrepresented\" the conversations caught on camera. \"In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios,\" the company said in a statement. \"Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps',\" it said. Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he regarded the report as a \"misrepresentation of the facts\" and said he felt the firm had been \"deliberately entrapped\".  On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it can provide data and insights to \"drive your voters to the polls and win your campaign\" and says it has played a \"pivotal role\" in winning US presidential races.   UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is investigating the company over claims it used personal data to influence the US election. Christopher Wylie, who worked with the company, claimed it amassed the data of millions of people through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life that was created by an academic. Ms Denham demanded access to the firm's databases and servers after it missed her Monday deadline. She said her office has been investigating political campaigning and the use of political data for many months - the allegations against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica were one strand of that work. She said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in \"an unauthorised way\", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when they found out about the loss of the data. She admitted she told Facebook to withdraw from its own search of Cambridge Analytica's offices, saying there were concerns it might damage the integrity of her investigation. \"Our advice to Facebook was to back away - and they agreed,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Labour's shadow digital economy minister Liam Byrne said Ms Denham's powers did not allow her to apply for a digital search warrant \"quickly and quietly\". Instead, she has \"told the world she's going to court\", giving Cambridge Analytica and others time to hide any evidence, he told the Today programme. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said her legal powers were inadequate and this matter had highlighted a need for \"greater powers and greater sanctions\". Ms Denham said she was using all the powers she had under the law but would not know whether evidence had been tampered with until her team of forensic experts gained access to the offices. Cambridge Analytica insists it followed the correct procedures in obtaining and using data, but it was suspended from Facebook last week. Facebook, meanwhile, will hold an open meeting with its employees later to discuss the matter, tech news website The Verge is reporting. Facebook said it has hired its own digital forensic team to audit Cambridge Analytica to find out whether the Facebook data in question still exists. \"If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made.\" Facebook said Aleksandr Kogan, who created the personality app from which the data had been harvested, has agreed to be audited, but Mr Wylie - who made the claims about the way the data was gathered and used - has declined. There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. \"The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,\" said a spokeswoman. \"Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43649018", "content": "Facebook believes the data of up to 87 million people was improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica - many more than previously disclosed.  The BBC has been told that about 1.1 million of them are UK-based. The overall figure had been previously quoted as being 50 million by the whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said \"clearly we should have done more, and we will going forward\". During a press conference he said that he had previously assumed that if Facebook gave people tools, it was largely their responsibility to decide how to use them. But he added that it was \"wrong in retrospect\" to have had such a limited view. \"Today, given what we know... I think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility,\" he said. \"That we're not just building tools, but that we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well.\" Mr Zuckerberg also announced an internal audit had uncovered a fresh problem. Malicious actors had been abusing a feature that let users search for one another by typing in email addresses or phone numbers into Facebook's search box. As a result, many people's public profile information had been \"scraped\" and matched to the contact details, which had been obtained from elsewhere. Facebook has now blocked the facility. \"It is reasonable to expect that if you had that [default] setting turned on, that in the last several years someone has probably accessed your public information in this way,\" Mr Zuckerberg said. The estimates of how many people's data had been exposed were revealed in a blog by the tech firm's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer. The BBC has also learned that Facebook now estimates that about 305,000 people had installed the This Is Your Digital Life quiz that had made the data-harvesting possible. The previously suggested figure had been 270,000. About 97% of the installations occurred within the US. However, just over 16 million of the total number of users affected are thought to be from other countries. A spokeswoman for the UK's Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that it was continuing to assess and consider the evidence before deciding what steps to take. Facebook has faced intense criticism after it emerged that it had known for years that Cambridge Analytica had collected data from millions of its users, but had relied on the London-based firm to self-certify that it had deleted the information. Cambridge Analytica said it had bought the information from the creator of the This Is Your Digital Life app without knowing that it had been obtained improperly. The firm says it deleted all the data as soon as it was made aware of the circumstances. But Channel 4 News has since reported that at least some of the data in question is still in circulation despite Cambridge Analytica insisting it had destroyed the material. During Mr Zuckerberg's press conference, Cambridge Analytica tweeted it had only obtained data for 30 million individuals - not 87 million - from the app's creator, and again insisted it had deleted all records. Cambridge Analytica licensed data from GSR for 30 million individuals, not 87 million. We did not receive more than 30 million records from research company GSR. End of Twitter post  by @CamAnalytica The latest revelations came several hours after the US House Commerce Committee announced that Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before it on 11 April. Facebook's share price has dropped sharply in the weeks since the allegations emerged. In his Wednesday blog post, Mr Schroepfer detailed new steps being taken by Facebook in the wake of the scandal. They include: Facebook has also published proposed new versions of its terms of service and data use policy. The documents are longer than the existing editions in order to make the language clearer and more descriptive. Another change the company announced involved limiting the type of information that can be accessed by third-party applications. Immediately after the changes were announced, however, users of the widely popular dating app Tinder were hit by login errors, leaving them unable to use the service.

When asked about this by the BBC, he said he had decided that his chief technology officer and chief product officer should answer questions from countries other than the US. He added, however, that he had made a mistake in 2016 by dismissing the notion that fake news had influenced the US Presidential election. \"People will analyse the actual impact of this for a long time to come,\" he added. \"But what I think is clear at this point is that it was too flippant and I should never have referred to it as crazy.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44250597", "content": "Popular video game critic John Bain - known as TotalBiscuit and the Cynical Brit - has died aged 33.

After a tweet appeared on his official account confirming his passing, his wife Genna posted a poem as a tribute to her late husband. She wrote: \"I'm more overwhelmed with grief than I could possibly express\". Mr Bain rose to prominence in 2010 by uploading gameplay videos and reviews to his YouTube channel.  He was a champion of many smaller, indie titles, producing videos where he shared his first impressions of new titles. He also curated lists of game recommendations on the Steam store. Mr Bain was also an outspoken critic of many popular top-selling games. He said many developers sought to maximise profit at the expense of game play. Video service Twitch, where Mr Bain live-streamed gaming sessions, thanked him for his contribution to the industry. \"John Bain's opinionated game critiques and sense of humour led to him becoming one of the most prominent voices in the gaming industry,\" it said in a statement. Prominent gamers took to Twitter to share their tributes. Mr Bain first contracted bowel cancer in 2014 but under treatment the disease went into remission.

The data centre, a white cylinder containing computers, could sit on the sea floor for up to five years. An undersea cable brings the data centre power and takes its data to the shore and the wider internet - but if the computers onboard break, they cannot be repaired. Orkney was chosen because it is a major centre for renewable energy research. The theory is that the cost of cooling the computers will be cut by placing them underwater.  \"We think we actually get much better cooling underwater than on land,\" says Ben Cutler, who is in charge of what Microsoft has dubbed Project Natick.  \"Additionally because there are no people, we can take all the oxygen and most of the water vapour out of the atmosphere which reduces corrosion, which is a significant problem in data centres.\" It will not be possible to repair the computers if they fail, but the hope is that there will be a lower failure rate than on land.  This is a tiny data centre compared with the giant sheds that now store so much of the world's information, just 12 racks of servers but with enough room to store five million movies.  Microsoft's first experimental underwater data centre, sunk for five months in 2015, was dubbed Leona Philpot after a character in an XBox game.  If Project Natick proves a success, Microsoft envisages sinking groups of five of these cylinders and being able to deploy a data centre offshore in 90 days, whereas it could take years on land.  The operation to sink the Orkney data centre has been an expensive multinational affair.  The cylinder was built in France by a shipbuilding company, Naval, loaded with its servers and then sailed from Brittany to Stromness in Orkney. There, another partner, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), provided help including the undersea cable linking the centre to the shore. The presence of EMEC, with its expertise in renewable energy and its knowledge of the seas around Orkney, was one factor behind Microsoft's decision to choose this location. \"We've got so much renewable energy here,\" says EMEC managing director Neil Kermode. \"We've produced more than we need since 2012.\"  The Orkney Islands were early adopters of wind energy. And EMEC has been experimenting with tidal and wave energy for 14 years, with one of its test sites on the beach where the Project Natick cable comes ashore. There has been growing concern that the rapid expansion of the data centre industry could mean an explosion in energy use.  But Emma Fryer, who represents the sector at Tech UK, says that fear has been exaggerated.  \"What's happened is we've had the benefit of Moore's Law,\" she says.  The continued advances in processing power have made doom-laden predictions look foolish, Ms Fryer says. \"We've been able to deal with explosions of data with only a small increase in the energy used.\" Nevertheless, she accepts there is a challenge as the industry continues to expand and she welcomes experiments such as Microsoft's. \"It's really exciting that they are thinking this radically,\" she says. Ms Fryer also thinks situating data centres near to or under the sea is a good idea. She says: \"50% of the world's population live near the coast.\" Another expert is not so sure.  Prof Ian Bitterlin, a data centre consultant for nearly 30 years, is sceptical about the environmental impact of going underwater. \"You just end up with a warmer sea and bigger fish,\" he says.  And 90% of Europe's data centres are in big cities such as London and Madrid because that is where they are needed. Microsoft's Ben Cutler insists the warming effect will be minimal - \"the water just metres downstream would get a few thousandths of a degree warmer at most\" - and the overall environmental impact of the Orkney data centre will be positive. As we bobbed about on a boat just above the site where the data centre was to be sunk the following day, I put it to him that many people might think the whole venture was a bit crazy. \"This is a crazy experiment that I hope will turn into reality\" he said. \"But this is a research project right now - and one reason we do different types of research into data centres is to learn what makes sense before we decide to take it to a larger scale.\" Now, the Project Natick team will monitor the data centre for the next five years. It could turn out to be a signpost to the future - or maybe just a tourist attraction for passing fish.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44783779", "content": "PayPal wrote to a woman who had died of cancer saying her death had breached its rules and that it might take legal action as a consequence.

Lindsay Durdle died on 31 May aged 37.  She had been first diagnosed with breast cancer about a year-and-a-half earlier. The disease had later spread to her lungs and brain. PayPal was informed of Mrs Durdle's death three weeks ago by her husband Howard Durdle. He provided the online payments service with copies of her death certificate, her will and his ID, as requested. He has now received a letter addressed in her name, sent to his home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire.

She voiced fears that it was impossible to say if the object may be a weapon. Russia has dismissed the comments as \"unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions\". The satellite in question was launched in October last year. \"[The satellite's] behaviour on-orbit was inconsistent with anything seen before from on-orbit inspection or space situational awareness capabilities, including other Russian inspection satellite activities,\" Ms Poblete told the conference on disarmament in Switzerland. \"Russian intentions with respect to this satellite are unclear and are obviously a very troubling development,\" she added, citing recent comments made by the commander of Russia's Space Forces, who said adopting \"new prototypes of weapons\" was a key objective for the force. Ms Poblete said that the US had \"serious concerns\" that Russia was developing anti-satellite weapons. Alexander Deyneko, a senior Russian diplomat, told the Reuters news agency that the comments were \"the same unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions, on suppositions and so on\". He called on the US to contribute to a Russian-Chinese treaty that seeks to prevent an arms race in space. Space weapons may be designed to cause damage in more subtle ways than traditional weapons like guns, which could cause a lot of debris in orbit, explained Alexandra Stickings, a space security expert at the Royal United Services Institute. \"[Such weapons may include] lasers or microwave frequencies that could just stop [a satellite] working for a time, either disable it permanently without destroying it or disrupt it via jamming,\" she said. But it was difficult to know what technology is available because so much information on space-based capabilities is classified, she added. She also said it would be very difficult to prove that any event causing interference in space was an intentional, hostile action by a specific nation state. Ms Poblete's comments were particularly interesting in light of President Donald Trump's decision to launch a sixth branch of the US armed forces named Space Force, added Ms Stickings. \"The narrative coming from the US is, 'space was really peaceful, now look at what the Russians and Chinese are doing' - ignoring the fact that the US has developed its own capabilities.\" A spokesman for the UK's Ministry of Defence said he could neither confirm nor deny any tracking of Russian satellites. \"There are a range of threats and hazards to all space capabilities in what is an increasingly contested domain,\" he said. \"These include the development of counter-space weapons by a number of nations.   \"The UK is working closely with international allies, including the US, to re-enforce responsible and safe behaviours in space and to build knowledge, understanding and resilience.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45686890", "content": "Facebook says almost 50 million of its users were left exposed by a security flaw.  The company said attackers were able to exploit a vulnerability in a feature known as \u201cView As\u201d to gain control of people's accounts.

The flaw has been fixed, wrote the firm\u2019s vice-president of product management, Guy Rosen, adding all affected accounts had been reset, as well as another 40 million \"as a precautionary step\". Facebook - which saw its share price drop more than 3% on Friday - has more than two billion active monthly users. The company has confirmed to reporters that the breach would allow hackers to log in to other accounts that use Facebook's system, of which there are many.  This means other major sites, such as AirBnB and Tinder, may also be affected. The firm would not say where in the world the 50 million users are, but it has informed Irish data regulators, where Facebook's European subsidiary is based. The company said the users prompted to log-in again did not have to change their passwords. \"Since we\u2019ve only just started our investigation, we have yet to determine whether these accounts were misused or any information accessed.

Facebook's \"View As\" function is a privacy feature that allows people to see what their own profile looks to other users, making it clear what information is viewable to their friends, friends of friends, or the public. Attackers found multiple bugs in this feature that \"allowed them to steal Facebook access tokens, which they could then use to take over people's accounts\", Mr Rosen explained. \"Access tokens are the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to Facebook so they don't need to re-enter their password every time they use the app,\" he added. The breach comes at a time when the firm is struggling to convince lawmakers in the US and beyond, that it is capable of protecting user data.  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call on Friday that the firm took security seriously, in the face of what he said were constant attacks by bad actors. But Jeff Pollard, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester, said the fact Facebook held so much data meant it should be prepared for such attacks. \"Attackers go where the data is, and that has made Facebook an obvious target,\" he said.  \"The main concern here is that one feature of the platform allowed attackers to harvest the data of tens of millions of users.  \"This indicates that Facebook needs to make limiting access to data a priority for users, APIs, and features.\" When asked by the BBC, Facebook was unable to say if the investigation would look into why the bugs were missed, or if anyone at the company would be held accountable for the breach.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45707211", "content": "Apple has remained silent amid complaints that its new iPhone XS and XS Max smartphones fail to charge consistently when plugged in.

Mr Hilsenteger presents the Unbox Therapy channel on YouTube, which has more than 12 million subscribers. In a video published on Saturday, he tested nine iPhones by plugging them into an official Apple power supply.  While the 2017 iPhone X charged without problem, many of the new XS and XS Max phones refused to charge when plugged in. Most of the phones would charge only when the display was activated to wake up the device. However, one of them would not charge at all. Mr Hilsenteger said he had been alerted to the problem when a viewer had emailed him describing their troubles. He had not noticed the issue himself because he used wireless charging rather than the power cable on his device. \"Responding to those people on a platform like this should bring light to it and hopefully some sort of software fix, if possible,\" he said in the video. \"This is my job.

Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. \"I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,\" he said in an all-staff email. \"I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society\u2026 and, yes, here at Google, too.\" A Twitter feed titled @googlewalkout documented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: \"We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded.\" Anger has boiled over in the past week since the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (\u00a369m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a \u201ccredible\u201d allegation of sexual misconduct.

At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Times\u2019 report had been \"difficult to read\".  Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: \"I\u2019m not at my desk because I\u2019m walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that\u2019s not working for everyone.\" They have also made formal demands to Google\u2019s management.

Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action.  \"Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening.  \"We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\"  Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism.  \"Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,\u201d said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business.  \"There are a lot of \u2018manbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money.

The device, hidden in an Apple Homepod box, used four smartphones, a circuit board and 1lb (453g) of glitter. Mark Rober, who is now a YouTuber, caught the original thieves on his home security camera. He decided to take action after the police said they were unable to investigate the case. He designed the elaborate bomb so that it would be activated when the package in which it was hidden was opened by thieves. The phone cameras and microphones would record the moment.  The device contained an accelerometer to detect motion. When the parcel was jostled, the device would check the GPS signal to see if it had been moved from its spot. If it had, then it would send a signal to activate the phones and start recording. The glitter was in a cup that spun round on a motor when released as the box was opened. The device was also engineered to squirt a tube of strong-smelling fart spray every 30 seconds. The package was left on Mr Rober's porch with a label saying it had been sent by \"Kevin McCallister\" - the boy played by Macaulay Culkin in the 1990 movie Home Alone. It was stolen on several occasions and re-set to explode and capture the footage every time. On every occasion, the thieves abandoned the package once it had been triggered and they or their property had been doused in glitter.

The newspaper has disclosed fresh details about ways the social network shared access to users' data with other tech firms, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify and Yandex. In some cases, the other companies have said they were not even aware they had special access. Facebook has defended its behaviour. It said it never gave others access to personal data without people's permission and had seen no evidence that the data had been misused. However, it has acknowledged again that it should have prevented third parties being able to tap into users' data, after publicly announcing that it had ended the privilege for security reasons. Examples given by the NYT include allowing others' products the ability to read users' private messages and to see the names, contact details and activities of their friends. Facebook's handling of the matter has drawn criticism, including tweets from its own former chief security officer Alex Stamos, who has called on it to disclose more details about what special access it provided to whom. The latest revelations follow a series of scandals including the Cambridge Analytica data harvest, incitement to violence in Myanmar, also known as Burma, evidence of Russian and Iranian meddling in the US elections, and several data-exposing bugs. These have undermined public confidence in Facebook, led to calls for new regulations and prompted demands for a leadership rethink. \"We have to seriously challenge the claim by Facebook that they are not selling user data,\" commented Damian Collins MP, chair of the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. \"They may not be letting people take it away by the bucket load, but they do reward companies with access to data that others are denied, if they place a high value on the business they do together. This is just another form of selling.\" The Irish Data Protection Commission, which takes the lead on Facebook in the EU, has issued a brief statement: \"We are aware of the media reporting from earlier today. We are currently assessing what next steps, if any, are required.\" Facebook, as ever, thinks it's being unfairly picked on. Indeed, as recently as this week, former security boss Alex Stamos described the Cambridge Analytica scandal as an overreaction. With its statement on Wednesday, Facebook took the same tone it has since this whole mess began in March: users gave consent, everybody knew, nothing to see here.  For added cheekiness, its statement linked to a piece in the New York Times from 2010 that seemed to reference at least one of the features revealed in this latest investigation. But what Facebook underestimates, continually, is the extent to which this year has produced a \"data-awakening\" among the general public, and how now is the time for the company to lay it all out on the table.  If I was a Facebook employee, or shareholder, I'd be telling Mark Zuckerberg: \"It's time to be completely open about who has or had access to data.\"  That's the only way to stop 2019 being like 2018: a drip-drip of headlines that have eroded Facebook's reputation, perhaps irreparably. The NYT bases its analysis on hundreds of pages of documents and dozens of interviews, the full details of which it has not shared. In total, it said the social network had special arrangements with more than 150 companies to share its members' personal data. Most of these, it said, were other tech firms, but the list also included online retailers, car-makers and media organisations, including the NYT itself, among others. Of the examples given it reported: Facebook has long maintained that it does not sell its users' data. But the NYT said that one of the arrangements it struck was to get contact lists from Amazon, Yahoo and Huawei, which it used to run its own People You May Know facility. The feature suggests more acquaintances users might want to add to their friends, which helps increase engagement. The firm distinguishes between two different types of relationships it formed. The first type it calls \"integration partnerships\". It defines these as arrangements that allowed others to offer Facebook's features outside of its own app or website. Facebook actually provided a long list of such partners to Congress in July. It said the arrangement made it possible for other companies to do things like consolidate posts from Facebook, Twitter and other social media providers in a single app, or provide alerts from a range of services via a web browser. But it noted that to do this, its members had to have signed into their Facebook accounts to give permission. It added that \"nearly all\" of these partnerships had been shut down in recent months. Facebook refers to the second type of arrangements as being \"instant personalisation\". It said these allowed other apps to see Facebook's private messages so that, for example you could send a song recommendation to a friend without having to leave Spotify's app.  The facility also ensured that if you deleted a message within a third-party app, it was also deleted in Facebook. \"No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission,\" added Facebook's product partnership chief Ime Archibong in a blog. \"Many news stories imply we were shipping over private messages to partners, which is not correct.\" Facebook said that users' public information was also shared so that, for example, you could see what TV shows your friends had watched within Netflix. Facebook said that for the most part, it ended its personalisation partnerships in 2014, but continued in some select cases into 2017. It acknowledged, however, that it had not always withdrawn the application programming interfaces (APIs) that allowed others to tap into its data, as it should have. \"We're in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them,\" it concluded. Microsoft has issued a brief statement saying: \"Throughout our engagement with Facebook, we respected all user preferences.\" The BBC understands it ended its Bing contract with Facebook in February 2016, and the social network's data stopped appearing in its search results at that point. Netflix has said that it stopped taking advantage of its ability to recommend content to members' Facebook friends in 2015 as the service had not been popular. \"At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so,\" it added. Spotify had indicated it was unaware of the degree of access Facebook had provided to it. Apple has also said that it was also not aware of its devices being granted special access. Yahoo said it only tapped into Facebook's data once users had opted in, and did not do so for advertising purposes. Yandex has said its arrangement was limited to users in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, and added that it stopped receiving Facebook's data in 2015. Amazon said it only used Facebook's information \"in accordance with our privacy policy\".  Part of the issue is that Facebook promised a US regulator - the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - in 2011 that it would not share user data without explicit consent. Facebook insists it has not breached that pledge, but some privacy experts suggest otherwise. Furthermore, despite Facebook executives claiming to have been transparent over the years about the firm's privacy policy shifts, campaign groups suggest new laws are needed to restrict its activities. \"Time and again Facebook has been unable to clearly and in plain language explain to people how the company is collecting, storing, sharing, and retaining people's data,\" a spokeswoman for Privacy International told the BBC. \"The sheer scope of the Facebook scandals in 2018 alone is mind-boggling and shows that data exploitation is a rampant and systemic.\" The other risk is that the more negative stories there are in the press, the more likely users are to quit Facebook and its other apps - including Instagram and WhatsApp - or at least stop sharing personal information with them.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45976300", "content": "Facebook has been fined \u00a3500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said Facebook had let a \"serious breach\" of the law take place. The fine is the maximum allowed under the old data protection rules that applied before GDPR took effect in May. The ICO said Facebook had given app developers access to people's data \"without clear consent\". In July, the ICO notified the social network that it intended to issue the maximum fine. Confirming the fine, it said in a statement: \"Between 2007 and 2014, Facebook processed the personal information of users unfairly by allowing application developers access to their information without sufficiently clear and informed consent, and allowing access even if users had not downloaded the app, but were simply 'friends' with people who had.\" \"Facebook also failed to keep the personal information secure because it failed to make suitable checks on apps and developers using its platform.\" Facebook said it was \"reviewing\" the ICO's decision. \"While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015,\" it said in a statement. Researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company GSR used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to 87 million people.  Some of this data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US.  \"Even after the misuse of the data was discovered in December 2015, Facebook did not do enough to ensure those who continued to hold it had taken adequate and timely remedial action, including deletion,\" the ICO said. The ICO found that more than one million people in the UK had their data harvested by the personality quiz.  \"A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better,\" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. The ICO is still investigating how data analytics is used for political purposes.  Ms Denham is due to give evidence to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee on 6 November.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45953238", "content": "Humans are often the weakest link in the chain when it comes to computer security. So how can we stop doing silly things that play into the hands of cyber criminals? When you ring IT support, you know the geek on the other end of the line thinks you're an idiot. It's the heavy sigh and patronising tone that give it away. In fact, they have an acronym for us - PEBKAC. It stands for Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair. That's you and me. And before you get on your high horse full of indignation, ask yourself: when did I last back up my data? How many online accounts do I use the same password for? How many times have I clicked on a link in an email without really knowing who sent it? Every year we're reminded how dumb we are when it comes to choosing passwords. These range from the obviously bad \"123456\" and \"password\", to the only marginally improved  \"12345678\" and \"admin\".  Other popular ones, according to a list drawn up from those found in breaches, are \"letmein\", \"iloveyou\", \"welcome\" and \"monkey\". With passwords like these, a child of two could probably break in to your account after bashing on the keyboard with a toy hammer for a few hours.   The fact is we're lazy. \"A lot of people forget their password and then just use the temporary password the IT department gave them,\" says Thomas Pedersen from OneLogin, an identity and access management company. \"The problem is that these temporary passwords can sometimes last a month.\" So in a large organisation, there are potentially hundreds of people using the same password. \"This makes them vulnerable to a password scrape attack - taking the most common passwords and trying them on millions of accounts,\" says Mr Pedersen.  \"The hackers will get a hit every 5,000 to 6,000 times.\"  Once inside the system, the hackers can cause havoc.  The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has also published lots of advice about choosing and using good passwords Major data breaches are becoming almost weekly occurrences, with Facebook, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, Reddit, Wonga, and Dixons Carphone joining a long list of corporate victims in recent months. Two-factor authentication - using your smartphone or a separate dongle to provide an extra layer of security on top of your main log-in details - is becoming more common, especially using biometrics such as voice, fingerprint, and facial recognition. But these are less suited to the corporate environment because desktops don't usually come with fingerprint readers or video cameras built in, Mr Pedersen points out. We're also pretty dumb when it comes to clicking on links and downloading content we shouldn't, says Ian Pratt, co-founder of cyber-security firm Bromium.  A lot of these links are loaded with malware - programs designed to burrow though corporate security systems, steal data or even take remote control of machines.  \"More than 99% of [malicious links] are run-of-the-mill criminal malware that are not targeted,\" he says. \"That malware is trying to spread pretty aggressively, but they do not use any clever tricks.\" The simple stuff works. \"More than 70% of the breaches that we hear about have started on a PC with some hapless user clicking on something that lets attackers get on to the network,\" says Mr Pratt. And hard-pressed IT departments have had their lives made even more difficult in recent years by the surge in mobile phones, laptops and tablets we use for work as well as for private purposes.  So, many large firms are focusing on making the desktop PC idiot-proof. Bromium's tech works by isolating each and every action that takes place on a PC - sandboxing to use the jargon. \"Almost every task performed effectively gets its own computer,\" explains Mr Pratt. \"As soon as you finish that task we effectively throw that laptop away and get out a new one.\" This means that if you click on a malicious link, the malware is isolated and can't escape to infect the rest of the network. But keeping an eye on what we're doing across a sprawling IT network is very hard, says Paul Farrington, a former chief technology officer for Barclays and now a consultant at security firm Veracode. Large organisations being clueless about the extent and reach of their IT assets is \"very common\", he says. A project Veracode carried out for one high street bank discovered 1,800 websites the organisation had not logged.  \"Their perimeter can be 50% larger than they originally thought it was,\" says Mr Farrington. And this ignorance can also extend to the number of computers - or \"endpoints\", in the jargon - sitting on a corporate network, says Nathan Dornbrook, founder and head of security firm ECS. One of his clients has more than 400,000 machines to manage, and several other customers have similar numbers. \"The machines could contain substantial amounts of information and customer data, passwords to internal systems, and all sorts of bits and pieces in the easy single sign-on applications that cache credentials locally,\" he says. In other words, just one of these PCs could be an Aladdin's cave to a hacker. \"If one attack gets inside,\" says Mr Dornbrook, \"you lose the whole enterprise.\" More Technology of Business So given that we're PEBKACs and IT departments are overloaded, automated systems are becoming increasingly necessary, cyber-security experts say. For example, ECS uses the Tachyon tool from security firm 1E to help monitor millions of PCs and keep them updated with the latest software patches and security updates. \"Otherwise you just don't have time to react,\" says Mr Dornbrook. Many other cyber-security companies are moving from a firewall approach to automated real-time traffic monitoring, looking for strange behaviour on the network. But it would certainly help if we all didn't behave like PEBKACs at work and casually give away the keys to the kingdom.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45471959", "content": "China has ambitions for its rapidly expanding Beidou satellite navigation system to serve the whole world, not just Asia, but will it really be able to rival the well-established - and US-owned - GPS system? Dalintai - a herder in northern China - used to travel miles every day on his motorcycle to deliver water for his livestock.  Now, according to the the Xinhua news agency, all he has to do is send a text message to operate an automated water delivery system.  \"I am able to deliver water to my sheep and cattle wherever and whenever I want via this system,\" he says. The message is relayed over China's expanding Beidou satellite navigation system, which is already being used used for transport, agriculture and even precision missiles.  Originally designed for the Chinese military to reduce reliance on the US-owned GPS, Beidou has turned into a commercial opportunity as its coverage has expanded. Last month, local authorities ordered 33,500 - about half of all taxis - in Beijing to install Beidou, and the Chinese government has set a goal that all new cars will be Beidou-guided by 2020. Domestic phone brands such as Huawei, Xiaomi and OnePlus are now Beidou-compatible, although Apple did not add the Chinese system to its new line-up of iPhones announced on 12 September.  China is increasingly keen to promote its technological prowess to the rest of the world. Yang Changfeng, the system's chief designer, has been vocal about his country's ambition to attract more overseas clients. \"China's Beidou is the world's Beidou, and the global satellite navigation market is certainly Beidou's market,\" he told Global Times last year. Named after the Chinese word for the Big Dipper or Plough constellation [Ursa Major], Beidou has been in the works for over two decades but only became operational within China in 2000 and the Asia-Pacific region in 2012.  When complete in 2020, it will have a constellation of 35 satellites to provide global coverage. This year alone, there have been more than 10 Beidou satellite launches - two more were launched this week. More are planned in what state media describe as a \"period with unprecedentedly intensive launches\".  By the end of 2018, it will cover countries along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) - a massive China-led infrastructure and trade programme, part of what it calls the \"Space Silk Road\". Beidou already covers 30 countries involved with the BRI, including Pakistan, Laos and Indonesia. \"There is certainly an aspect of this that is about expanding influence, but part of it is likely also about economic security,\" Alexandra Stickings, from the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, tells the BBC. A global navigation system that can rival GPS is a big part of China's ambition to be a global leader in space, Ms Stickings says. \"The main advantage of having your own system is security of access, in the sense that you are not relying on another country to provide it. The US could deny users access over certain areas, for example in times of conflict.\" It could also serve as a back-up if GPS were to go down entirely.   Currently, there are three other satellite navigation systems - Russia's Glonass, Europe's Galileo, and GPS - which is the most-widely used.  The UK is also considering building its own satellite navigation system as it may not be able to access Galileo post-Brexit. So could Beidou really become the world's most popular system? \"We are likely to see an increased bifurcation of the world into two camps - 'pro-China' and 'pro-US',\" says Blaine Curcio, founder of Orbital Gateway Consulting, a Hong Kong-based satellite market research firm. \"And from this perspective, those that go 'pro-China' may be more likely to be distrusting of US and EU satellite navigation services.\"  But Mr Curcio adds that although the public in developing nations may benefit from having another sat-nav option, in general, there is \"no real pressing need\".  Chinese officials claim that the third-generation Beidou will be as accurate and reliable as GPS, if not more so. Ran Chengqi, director of the China Satellite Navigation Office, says the system will have a positioning accuracy of 2.5m (8.2ft), which will further be improved to centimetre-level accuracy with additional ground stations.  Meanwhile, the cost of Beidou receiver chips that track and process the satellite signals has fallen in recent years, bringing it on a par with GPS tech.  But despite its technological sophistication, Beidou has a supposed flaw - a two-way transmission process that involves satellites sending signals to earth and devices transmitting signals back. This can compromise accuracy and takes up more spectrum bandwidth.  In contrast, GPS devices do not have to transmit signals back to the satellites. \"Developing and operating a global satellite navigation system is very difficult,\" explains Brian Weeden, director at the Secure World Foundation. \"It's one thing to get it working, it's another to keep it working consistently and create trust among users.\"  The biggest strength of GPS has been its consistency and reliability over the last few decades, adds Mr Weeden.  \"It doesn't just broadcast an accurate signal; it has done so without hardly any interruption for decades.\" Of perhaps more concern to Western governments is President Xi Jinping's strategy to develop a smaller, smarter military - and Beidou's crucial role in this. The army is apparently using Beidou for precision-guided missiles, reconnaissance exercises, and as a short messaging platform - something that GPS does not have. \"There is no doubt of the benefits to the military of enhanced accuracy and an increase from regional to global coverage,\" Ms Stickings notes.  \"A potential benefit to the military could be in how it could deny or degrade the signal received by other users of the system.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44482380", "content": "What's it like being the victim of a live cyber-attack? What should you do to protect your company from further damage? And should you pay that ransom demand? Technology of Business eavesdropped on a \"war games\" exercise hosted by cyber security firm Forcepoint that was based on lots of real-life experiences.  IT staff at fictional High Street optician Blink Wink's head office have been suckered by a phishing email. Someone clicked on a link to a spoof website because they thought the email looked legitimate. It wasn't. That was two months ago. Today, the proverbial hits the fan... Tony Lewis, Blink Wink's IT administrator, starts his day clearing out the company's public email inbox of the usual junk and spam. One message stands out. His stomach lurches. \"I have more where this came from. We will be in touch shortly with our demands,\" the text says below someone's name, credit card details and email address. Tony hopes it's a hoax, but can't take the risk. He swallows hard and calls the firm's security officer, Doug Hughes. Doug isn't impressed as he's on holiday in New York where it's 3:30am. \"This better be good,\" he growls. Tony forwards the suspect email.  \"Have we validated the credit card number?\" Doug asks, tension evident in his voice now. \"Is it one of our customers?\" \"I don't know yet,\" admits Tony.  \"Well, when did we get this?\" Doug snaps.  \"Um... well... it seems we got it yesterday just after I'd left work, so I didn't notice it until this morning.\" \"So we're at least 12 hours into this?\" \"Um, yeah,\" Tony mumbles sheepishly. \"We've got a second email,\" Tony tells Doug. \"It's a ransom demand for \u00a315,000 in the Litecoin crypto-currency. We have to pay by 22:00 BST or they'll delete all our customer records.\" \"What?\" shouts Doug. \"I thought they only had one?\" \"Um, no. They claim to have them all.\" In a sweat, Doug calls Blink Wink's legal counsel Grace Bolton for advice. She has to dial in several times as her headset is malfunctioning. Her voice keeps cutting out during the conversation. \"This is obviously a potential breach,\" she says. \"So do not respond to that message. I'll need to review existing legislation so we know where we stand.\" \"What about the police?\" asks Doug, his romantic city break now thoroughly ruined. \"And the Information Commissioner? What about GDPR, who do we notify?\" Things are spiralling out of control for Blink Wink. The hackers have posted a tranche of customer names and credit card numbers on Pastebin, a public website for sharing text and source code. Doug has now confirmed that the data is genuine. \"Shouldn't we shut down the website?\" asks Tony. \"Then we'll limit the risk.\" Grace butts in. \"Before we do that, who do we need to tell first? What's our data breach policy?\" \"I thought that came from legal,\" says Doug. \"Aren't you the data protection officer?\" Grace asks Tony. \"Nope, not me...\" \"God, is it me?\" asks Doug despairingly. \"Anyway, if we pull the website that'll just draw attention to ourselves won't it? Not sure that's the right thing to do.\" \"Me neither,\" says Grace. Blink Wink's head of public relations, Sandra Ellis, has been looped in to the conversation.  \"This isn't looking good,\" she says rather obviously. \"We've failed to protect our customers' private data. We could get really hammered for this.\" She points out that the firm has a \"buy one get one free\" contact lens promotion running at the moment.  \"We're driving people to the website right now. Are their details being stolen too?\" \"Very possibly,\" says Doug. \"We've got to shut down the site - or parts of it anyway. And then we've got to decide whether to pay the ransom.\" Sandra Ellis has drafted a public statement but doesn't propose releasing it to the media until people start asking questions.  \"We'll just say we are experiencing an incident and do it reactively,\" she says. \"Not an incident - a breach,\" Doug advises. \"No, don't use the word 'breach' - not yet anyway,\" chips in Grace, thinking of the legal ramifications. Tony bursts in on the conference call. \"We've found some malware! We saw an email come in that went to quarantine so we checked it out and it had an attachment. That could be it.\" \"You didn't click on it did you?\" asks Doug, his day going from bad to worse. \"Um... I just thought it would speed things up...\"  Doug swears and dips out of the call to get his security staff to check for any more damage. Grace turns the conversation to informing the Information Commissioner's Office. \"We can phone or report it online,\" she tells them. \"But we need to say what we did to mitigate the problem.\" \"Well, we were meant to get the latest threat detection software last year, but the guy who was looking into that left and wasn't replaced,\" says Tony. \"It kinda didn't happen.\" \"Well don't tell the ICO that,\" Grace barks. \"If we can't show we had adequate controls in place we could be in trouble. And the cyber-insurance people might not pay out either.\" Later, Doug confirms that the latest phishing email was a red herring, but informs the team: \"They did find a phishing email sent two months ago that linked to a log-in page made to look like the one for our cloud provider. That's how they got in. \"We've got to handle things better from now on,\" Doug concludes. \"This will happen again, and it's only going to get worse.\" Richard Ford, chief scientist at Forcepoint, says: \"Reacting late has put Blink Wink on the back foot. You need to move quickly in these situations otherwise the attackers dictate the pace.  \"A poor knowledge of data breach laws has made the company vulnerable.

Many firms are now harnessing big data and adopting cutting edge verification checks. In fact, some can even identify you by how quickly you type your computer keys, or how you hold your mobile phone. In these days of regular space travel, nanotechnology and quantum computers it is easy to believe we live in an age plucked from the pages of a science-fiction novel. But there are some aspects of this shiny, computer-powered era that look more feudal than futuristic.  Consider the way many organisations protect themselves and their staff from cyber-attacks. Many approach cyber-security like a medieval king would have tackled domestic security - by building a castle to protect themselves, says Dr Robert Blumofe, a senior manager at cloud services firm Akamai. The high walls, moat and drawbridge are the security tools, anti-virus and firewalls they use to repel the barbarians at the gates trying to breach their cyber defences.  \"But now,\" Dr Blumofe says, \"that castle metaphor is really starting to break down.\" The first issue is mobility. Digital fortifications worked well when all staff sat at desks, used desktop computers and were concentrated in a few buildings. But now many work from home, airports or coffee shops and use their laptops, tablets and phones on the go, to work at all times of day. The second problem, Dr Blumofe says, is that many firms wrongly assume that those in inside their castle walls can be trusted and are \"safe\".  This leaves many firms dangerously exposed, agrees John Maynard, European head of cyber-security for Cisco. \"Typically once attackers have penetrated a trusted network they find it is easy to move laterally and easy to get to the crown jewels. \"That's because all the defences point outward. Once on the inside there is usually little to stop attackers going where they want to.\" In a bid to get beyond this outdated thinking many organisations have torn down the old castle walls in favour of a model known as the \"Beyond Corp\" approach. It was pioneered by Google in response to a series of cyber-attacks in 2009 called Aurora orchestrated by China-backed hackers. The attackers went after Google as well as Adobe, Yahoo, Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical and many other large firms. According to Mr Maynard, Beyond Corp assumes every device or person trying to connect to a network is hostile until they are proven otherwise. And it obtains this proof by analysing external devices, how they are being used and what information they are submitting. This encompasses obvious stuff such as login names and passwords, as well as where someone logs in from; but it also relies on far more subtle indicators, says Joe Pindar, a security strategist at Gemalto,  \"It can be how quickly do you type the keys, are you holding the device in your right or left hand. How an individual uses a device acts as a second layer of identity and a different kind of fingerprint.\" Gathering, storing and analysing all that data on those individual quirks of usage was the type of big data problem only a tech-savvy company such as Google could tackle at the time of the Aurora attacks, says Mr Pindar. However, as familiarity with big data sets has spread, many more big firms are adopting the Beyond Corp approach when organising their digital defences, he says.   One big advantage is that Beyond Corp turns a firm's network into an active element of defence, says Mr Maynard from Cisco.  More Technology of Business \"In the castle and moat approach the network was passive... But beyond Corp involves continuous monitoring where you are constantly using the network as a sensor or a way to get telemetry about what's going on.\" The analysis done when users join a network makes it much easier to spot when attackers are trying to get access. That's because the authentication step will flag any anomalies meaning security staff will find out quickly that something suspicious is going on. Anything other than normal login behaviour will stand out. Faster detection It can also mean a \"significant reduction\" in time to detect threats, says Mr Maynard.  \"The industry average is about 100 days to spot threats. With Beyond Corp you should be down to hours not days.\" In addition, Beyond Corp can \"limit the blast radius\" if a breach does happen, says Stephen Schmidt, chief security officer at Amazon's AWS cloud service. This is because it usually involves dividing up a company's internal network so users only get access to applications they are approved to use. The mass of data gathered on users, their devices and the way they act once they have connected may appear bewildering to many companies.  However, advances in automation are increasingly helping them keep a handle on the millions of events that now occur on their systems.  \"If you are expecting to secure your estate by having humans watch TV screens you are probably going to be too late to spot it,\" says Mr Schmidt. \"Human reactions are always going to be much slower than automation.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44110588", "content": "These days disgruntled customers can vent their spleen on social media instantly, but many companies are not handling these platforms properly, experts say. So what are the dos and don'ts of social media customer relations? There are days when you get angry about how a company has treated you, there only seems to be one way to make it right. Take to Twitter. Voicing a grievance on a company's public feed has become the main way to get your complaint heard. Right now. \"Somehow Twitter has become the channel for people that are really [expletive] off with an organisation,\" says Lyndsay Menzies, chief executive of digital marketing agency 8 Million Stories (8MS), which advises on managing social media. And Twitter's immediacy has led customers to think they should receive answers equally quickly, thinks Ms Menzies. \"It's made consumers much more demanding in terms of what they want and expect.\" But this need for speed has led to some disastrous Twitter gaffes, from US Airways accidentally including a pornographic image in a reply to an unhappy customer, to Microsoft's artificially \"intelligent\" chatbot Tay tweeting racist and antisemitic views after been corrupted by mischievous internet trolls.  Used well, on the other hand, with wit and flair, and Twitter can earn a company new-found respect.  Take dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster, for example, which took advantage of the United Airlines forced removal of a passenger scandal in 2017 and sent this mischievous tweet:   \ud83d\udcc8'Volunteer' means \u201csomeone who does something without being forced to do it.\u201d https://t.co/qNAcMyplhZ End of Twitter post  by @MerriamWebster It received around 64,000 likes. But many companies are failing to manage their social interactions well, believes Ms Menzies, largely because they feel the pressure to be on all platforms all the time.  The weight of this burden became apparent early this year when pub chain Wetherspoons said it was shutting down its social media channels as they were a \"distraction\" for its staff. And this risks confusing customers with scattered, inconsistent messaging. Wayne Guthrie, co-founder of the Fearlessly Frank digital consultancy, believes social media should not be seen as just another channel through which to send messages.  \"Social media is about behaviour, not communication,\" he says.  Organisations need to show customers what they're doing, not just tell them. For instance, if a customer's order goes astray, the social media dialogue about the incident should show what the company has done to resolve the problem. \"It should be used to make a customer feel like an organisation is really doing something on their behalf,\" he says. But this is no easy task, as firms have to gather and pass on information quickly - being open and transparent takes commitment and resources, he observes. Flowers-through-the-post firm Bloom & Wild is one company that has tried to live up to the expectations of social media, says Isobel Murray, the firm's \"head of customer delight\". Social media should be about building relationships with customers, she argues. \"We want to make it easy and appealing for anyone to get in touch with us, and social media provides a great way to do this,\" she says.  \"It's where people spend lots of their time and it's great to meet them where they are.\" The same staff work on all Bloom & Wild's social media accounts so the tone and personality of the messages stays consistent, she adds. And this consistency of brand personality across all channels is crucial, argues Ms Menzies. \"One of the things that annoys people is the different types of voice companies have in different areas,\" she says. Businesses \"need to think about what they are as a brand and what their business does\" before taking to social media, she advises.  Once the brand values and personality have been carefully worked out and agreed, they can then be communicated to staff handling the different channels and interacting with customers. And this openness and consistency of tone should apply as much when things are going badly as when they're going well, says Bloom & Wild's Ms Murray. \"We never want to be defensive or ignore a problem,\" she says. \"We want to hear from every customer - to celebrate their joys but also quickly put right anything that's gone wrong.\" Getting social media right is tough for technical reasons, too, says Jack Barmby, chief executive of customer management software firm Gnatta. This is partly because most of the apps, sites and networks are designed for individuals not businesses, he believes. \"Businesses have had to hijack social media channels, and that's meant putting square pegs in round holes and trying to adapt them to their purposes,\" he says. One example of this was Instagram letting its commercial users tag items in shared images so people could buy them. This helped firms sell stuff but didn't give them a way to respond to customer queries about the featured items. The world of social media got a little easier to navigate earlier this year when WhatsApp released tools that let brands talk directly to customers through the app.  But for a long time it has been tough for firms to interact with customers via these other, popular, social media channels. Small wonder then that people resort to Twitter when they are cross and have a point to make. The irony is that the huge amount of information people share via their social media profiles, apps, chat groups and blogs gives companies a golden opportunity to know much more about their customers and target them with much more specific messaging. More Technology of Business \"If you email an organisation it will get very little information about who you are from that address,\" says Mr Barmby. \"But with social, over all the channels, you get so much more information.\" Ally this social data with all the existing data a company has about its customers - spending histories, company interactions and so on - and you can make better decisions about how to communicate with that person, he argues. And the more you know about your customers - particularly the most influential ones on social media - the better you can nip complaints in the bud before they become full-blown Twitter public relations crises. \"Businesses have never admitted it, but influencers tend to get answers more quickly,\" says Mr Barmby. In these days of YouTubers with hordes of followers, Instagram stars and Twitter armies, that ability to react quickly and appropriately would seem to make a lot of sense.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37154519", "content": "Is the smartphone app doomed? To look at the stats you wouldn't think so: Apple has two million of them in its App Store and Google Play has a few hundred thousand more than that. Total app downloads have passed the 150 billion mark. But some are wondering whether apps are about to be replaced by something smaller, smarter and faster.  Bots. These programs, thanks to AI [artificial intelligence] software in the cloud, can chat to humans via text, extract the meaning and then act on it.  They are little digital helpers. Any time you see a live chat box open up on a retailer's website, or order a taxi or flowers through chat platforms such as WeChat and Facebook Messenger, you're most likely talking to a bot.   Despite the vast choice of apps open to us, the average number we use is 27, according to research by Nielsen. This hasn't changed for years. And the problem with apps - and their seemingly endless updates - is that they eat up our smartphone storage capacity alarmingly quickly.  Developers often get a raw deal as well. One estimate suggests that 94% of the cash generated by apps in Apple's App Store goes to just 1% of publishers, and those firms also get 70% of all downloads. \"One of the worst things about the App Store is the App Store itself, because it's such a walled garden,\" says Ted Nash of Tapdaq, who was a veteran app developer while still a teenager. Apple's oversight of all apps slows down development and forces programmers to include specific chunks of code that look after adverts, usage statistics and other metrics, he says. Add to this the trouble of making apps work across lots of different devices and keeping up with changes to Apple software, and it's no wonder some people are disillusioned, he says.  So is app fatigue setting in? \"Apps used to be the big thing,\" says Kriti Sharma, head of mobile development at accounting software firm Sage. \"But many more people are messaging than are posting on social media these days.\" This is why she thinks bots are the natural successors to apps - the interface is instantly familiar to customers.  Ms Sharma started her coding career at Barclays, where she co-created its Pingit banking app and oversaw its mobile portfolio. For companies or brands that want meaningful interaction with customers, a conversation mediated by a bot could work well, she believes. Sage is developing a bot called Pegg that acts as a smart business assistant. It will help small business owners keep track of outgoings and expenses, making tracking cashflow easier. \"Bots don't have to be super-complicated,\" says Ms Sharma. \"But over time they must add a lot more value for a customer.\" Bots are more credible because good progress has been made in writing artificially intelligent software, she says. And also because many companies now have huge amounts of data they can use to fine-tune bot responses. Another advantage bots have over apps is the speed with which they can be developed, deployed and updated, she argues.  This growing interest is being inflated by work at Facebook, Microsoft and Google, as well as by newer firms such as Slack and HipChat. And start-ups such as Begin, Growbot, Butter, Wisdom and Operator are also helping to take bots mainstream. One catalyst for the interest was Facebook's announcement earlier this year of a bot framework that streamlines the bot-creation process. One report suggests that this massive amount of interest has unleashed a $4bn (\u00a33bn) flood of venture capital funding into big and small bot developers.  \"Bots are the new black,\" says Jon Moore, chief product officer at rail ticket booking service, The Trainline. Although most people now use The Trainline via a smartphone and many regular users have installed its app, the company is keen to investigate what bots can do, Mr Moore says. For booking train tickets, a website or an app is profoundly better than using a bot, he maintains, but there are times when an app falls short and a conversation handled by a bot may be better. \"We're just at the point of saying it's another interesting piece of technology,\" he tells the BBC. \"We expect that they are going to be useful to us, though it won't work for every context and circumstance.\" Tapdaq's Ted Nash warns that though bots might look straightforward, they're not necessarily an easier option. \"A bot is a much more simple technology from a customer perspective, but the AI that powers it is immensely complicated to do,\" he says.  That difficulty often means that bots are pretty crude. \"A lot of them now have pre-defined inputs and responses,\" says Mr Nash. \"The only way they are going to become truly ubiquitous is when they can respond as a human would.\" But even before they do that, says Nick Lane, chief analyst at consultancy MobileSquared, bots are likely to be useful for smoothing out the interactions between customers and companies. \"We'll see bots helping out with customer engagement, queries and product enquiries,\" he says.  But there is danger in relying too much on a technology still in the early stages of development, he warns. \"Some companies are wondering if they can put their business and reputation in the hands of a computer program.\" There is another reason why technology firms are keen to use text-based chatbots, says Mr Lane.  \"It could be that they see this interaction as another form of data mining,\" he says. \"People should ask how that information and conversation is going to be used. \"One way or another there is a model evolving around that communication that will see it being monetised.\" Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter Click here for more Technology of Business features", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46693156", "content": "The public could be put at risk if the UK leaves the EU in March without an official agreement, the UK's most senior police officer has said. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said a no-deal exit would threaten access to EU-wide criminal databases and make it harder to extradite people from abroad. She told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed. Parliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it. The prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc. After Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects. The agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.  Please upgrade your browser The priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome. Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit. While she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\". \"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can. \"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\" A no deal Brexit could \"put the public at risk\" because of reduced security collaboration with the EU, says Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick #r4today https://t.co/v9XVVpWbcm pic.twitter.com/mABJ3J6ojW End of Twitter post  by @BBCr4today The Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit. She also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary. \"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.  \"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\" Ms Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU. But campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.  The organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.  \"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.  The Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.  \"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this. In the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers. She said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".  The authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working out what had happened and there would have to be much closer working between the private sector and the military to ensure there was no repeat.

Ministers hope to begin negotiating deals with key partners once the UK leaves the EU in March and start implementing them from 2021 onwards. The International Trade Committee said MPs must have a \"meaningful role\" in ratifying deals, with scrutiny at an early stage and a decisive final vote. The government is not obliged to give Parliament a vote on treaties it signs. However, ministers bowed to pressure and agreed to give MPs a vote on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU which, if the Commons approves it next month, will take the form of a treaty. Theresa May faces an uphill struggle getting the agreement through the Commons, having postponed the crucial vote earlier this month in the face of what looked like a heavy defeat. Many Tory MPs are concerned that the agreement will keep the UK indefinitely tied to EU rules and regulations, and hamper its ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US and Canada. US President Donald Trump has questioned the value of a future trade deal with the UK if it is not able to alter its tariffs and regulations.  But, at the same time, campaigners have warned that the UK may be forced to water down food safety, consumer protection and environmental standards to reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners.  MPs are calling for Parliament to be given an enhanced role in considering future trade agreements once the UK regains the power to negotiate its own deals. The cross-party committee is urging the government to operate from a \"presumption of transparency rather than secrecy\" in negotiating the UK's post-Brexit trade policy. Its new report suggests MPs debate a substantive, amendable motion before negotiations are under way, once the government has agreed an outline approach - allowing Parliament to express its \"concerns or objections\", and lowering the risk of it rejecting eventual negotiated agreements. The committee also recommends that the government hold regular consultations with interested parties, such as businesses, to enable them to share their opinions while the devolved administrations should have a statutory role in the process. The SNP's Angus MacNeil, who chairs the committee, said the government's current plans for Parliamentary input were \"characteristically vague\". \"Our report makes an unequivocal argument for transparency over secrecy, consultation over concealment, and parliamentary debate over simple rubber-stamping,\" he said. \"If the proper processes and protections are not put in place from the outset, the government may fail to realise the UK-wide post-Brexit benefits it has gone to such lengths to promote.\" A Department for International Trade spokesperson said it had been \"very clear that we will not lower food standards as part of any new free trade agreement\".

Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. \"Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,\" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Confusingly the 83-page document does not forecast the impact of the prime minister's current deal. Instead it looks at the potential impact of the proposals agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers in July, which is the basis of the current proposal. Under those circumstances the economy would be 3.9% smaller than if the UK had remained part of the European Union. The estimates do not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that 3.9% of GDP would equate to about \u00a3100bn a year by the 2030s. The government report also examines three other possible scenarios including a no-deal Brexit, which would be the most damaging. The economy will continue to grow under all the scenarios, but there is a wide variation in how much. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis questioned the research, saying previous Treasury forecasts had been proved wrong and were based on \"flawed assumptions\". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the planned Brexit deal combined most of the economic benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU. Asked if the UK would be poorer under Mrs May's deal, he said: \"The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister's preferred version of the future partnership.\" But Mr Hammond argued that staying in the EU was not politically \"viable\". Veteran Conservative Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash said Mr Hammond was effectively arguing for the UK to stay in the European Union in his \"extraordinary\" statement. He said the chancellor had ignored potential economic benefits of leaving the EU, asking: \"What about the trade deals which could give us the most enormous opportunities throughout the world, if we are able to strike them?\" Under Mrs May's deal, the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals during the transition period after 29 March's Brexit day, but would not be able to implement them until the end of the planned 21-month transition period, which could itself be extended. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal.  That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't. The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth.  There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option.  That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate.

But that's not the only treat 2019 has in store. From Stormzy to The Spice Girls, the next 12 months will see the return of the planet's biggest pop stars, and a few exciting new names taking their first steps into the big league. Here's a not-entirely-comprehensive preview of the year ahead.  2018 was a fallow year for most of pop's A-listers - with a knock-on effect on album sales, which fell by an estimated 25%. But the new year promises a crop of major releases that could reverse that trend. 1) Rihanna - To be confirmed It's been three years since Rihanna last graced fans with new music, but the long wait for a follow-up to Anti may soon be over.  In response to a fan asking \"When is the album dropping?\" on Instagram, the star simply stated: \"2019\". Her long-term vocal producer Kuk Harrell also teased details about Rihanna's ninth album, telling fans: \"R9 is great. R9 is amazing. It's incredible, And that's all I'm going to say.\" That's about all we know - although it's likely RiRi will also appear on the soundtrack to Guava Island, the mysterious film she's been shooting with Childish Gambino in Cuba. 2) Lana Del Rey - Norman Rockwell Back in November, Lana Del Rey released two singles that updated her trademark sound with a washed-out psychedelia. The highlight was the 10-minute-long Venice Bitch, a dreamy love song evoking faded summers, Robert Frost and Norman Rockwell - after whom she's named her sixth album. It's being produced by Jack Antonoff, whose work with Lorde, Taylor Swift and St Vincent has resulted in some of the most complex, intelligent pop of the last five years. The album is due in March, preceded by (uh-oh) a book of poetry. 3) The 1975 - Notes on a Conditional Form End of Youtube post  by BBCRadio1VEVO Recorded at the same time as 2018's A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, The 1975's fourth album is due in the summer - part of singer Matty Healy's plan to combat the constant-consumption culture of modern pop.  \"Very early on, [Matt] noted that the promotional window on music is shorter than ever, and the time that people consume it is infinite,\" the band's manager Jamie Oborne told Music Week. \"If we have a tour cycle that's going to last 18 months to two years, we have to release two records in the time that we would have previously have released one.\" Matty's father, actor Tim Healy, confirmed the band had recorded one of his songs for the album. Had a brill day recording a song I wrote when Matty was 11 he wanted it on his new album yippee you can hear it in April love you guys xxxx pic.twitter.com/2v5XJdp1Rh End of Twitter post  by @TheRealTimHealy 4) Dua Lipa - To be confirmed Like The 1975, Dua Lipa knows attention spans are getting shorter, so she's plugged the gap between her Brit Award-winning debut and her in-progress second album with a clutch of collaborations with Mark Ronson, Diplo, Calvin Harris and... er, Andrea Bocelli. Meanwhile, she's been hitting the studio with the likes of Max Martin (Britney, Taylor Swift) MNEK (Little Mix, Beyonce), Andrew Wyatt (Lorde, Bruno Mars), Sarah Hudson (Katy Perry, Camila Cabello) Justin Tranter (Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez) and Swedish pop star Tove Lo. The singer told Rolling Stone she'd been listening to Prince, Outkast and Gnarls Barkley in the studio, explaining the album \"has some throwback elements, which I'm excited about 'cause it's a new direction for me\". 5) Stormzy - To be confirmed \"They told me back in summer I should drop a summer tune/But I've been working hard, the second album's coming soon.\" Stormzy teased his new album in a freestyle, 4pm In London, earlier this year. And with a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon, we should expect new material sooner rather than later. Like his debut, Gang Signs & Prayer, the album's been recorded with producer Fraser T Smith, who said the star had reached new levels with \"his singing voice, the delivery of his raps [and] his musicality\". He told Music Week: \"There's no way he's going to be just recycling Gang Signs & Prayer.\" 6) Foals - To be confirmed Foals' first album since 2015's What Went Down is also their first without founding bassist Walter Gervers, and the indications are that it will see the band make a big sonic shift. \"It's evolution versus extinction,\" frontman Yannis Philippakis told the Oxford Union last year. \"What we need to do is go through some sort of violent change and make sure, whatever the next record is, it's not friends with the last two.\" 7) Ariana Grande - Thank U, Next End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Ariana Grande's Sweetener - which came sixth in our best albums of 2018 - was only released in August, but the pop star has already hit the studio to record the follow-up. That's partly because life has moved on - the love affair that inspired Sweetener's most romantic moments has ended - and partly because she's fed up with the music industry's relentless album-tour cycle. \"My dream has always been to be - obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does,\" she told Billboard. \"It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.\" The first single, Thank U, Next, topped the charts for six weeks in the UK, pushing back plans to release the album before the end of 2018, but it seems likely Ariana's fifth album will be out before her Sweetener World Tour kicks off in March. 8) Madonna - To be confirmed Madonna's 14th studio album [discounting her various soundtrack albums] is ready to roll, ahead of a rumoured Glastonbury appearance in June.  Tentatively titled Magic, it sees the star back in the studio with French \"disco god\" Mirwais, who co-produced Music and American Life; and Mike Dean, who's best known for working with Kanye West and Frank Ocean. She deliberately restricted her pool of collaborators after the anything goes approach of 2015's Rebel Heart, writing on Instagram: \"Remember when I made records with other artists from beginning to end and I was allowed to be a visionary and not to have to go to songwriting camps where no-one can sit still for more than 15 minutes?\" 9) Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings End of Youtube post 2 by BBCRadio1VEVO Trailed by the monumental Miley Cyrus collaboration Nothing Breaks Like A Heart, Mark Ronson's fifth record is a classic break-up album, prompted by his divorce from French model and actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume. Describing the project as a collection of \"sad bangers\", the producer told the BBC: \"I tried doing some other music, whatever I could do not to relive Uptown Funk, but the only stuff that started to stick was the stuff that moved me and made me feel melancholy.\" 10) Taylor Swift - To be confirmed The three-year gap between Taylor Swift's 1989 and Reputation was the longest she'd ever made fans wait for new music. But with a new recording contract signed and sealed, it looks like TS7 could be on its way by the end of 2019. Although nothing's confirmed yet, the star told Perez Hilton her seventh album \"will definitely be out before I'm 30\" next December, while fans are convinced she's teasing a new album via the medium of Scrabble tiles.  Let the games BEGIN. A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 21, 2018 at 12:55am PDT End of Instagram post  by taylorswift And that's not all...

With Charli XCX singing about 1999 and Anne-Marie reminiscing about 2002, nostalgia for the turn of the millennium is in full swing - so it only seems appropriate that The Spice Girls are heading off on their second reunion tour - without the help of Posh, who's apparently got a global fashion empire to oversee. Their 13-date stadium tour kicks off in Dublin on 24 May and rattles around the UK before landing in Wembley Stadium for three nights in June. If that's not enough 90s nostalgia for you, the new year will also see tours by Take That, Boyzone and Backstreet Boys. Massive Attack will also be back, staging an ambitious 21st anniversary production of their 1998 album Mezzanine, which they describe as \"our own personalised nostalgia nightmare head trip\". Over in Las Vegas, Lady Gaga ushers in the new year with a game-changing residency that juggles two shows - a greatest hits extravaganza and a more intimate piano-jazz soiree.  Former Vegas stalwart Cher, meanwhile, hits the road in the autumn for her first world tour in 14 years. With wry self-awareness, the show is titled The Here We Go Again Tour, and will focus on her recent album of Abba covers. The actual Abba are, for the 26th year in a row, refusing to reform, although a \"hologram tour\" is supposedly in the works, as is a TV special featuring two new songs from Sweden's finest. And palaeontologists will be pleased to hear that 2019 is a bumper year for rock dinosaurs - with Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, Sir Elton John, Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton all touching down in the UK.  Catch them while you still can... After the success of The Greatest Showman, Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star Is Born this year, Hollywood is scrambling to capitalise on the apparent appetite for musicals. 2019 will see new film adaptations of Cats, The Lion King and Aladdin, but the most-anticipated of the lot has to be the Frozen sequel, which is due in December. There's also a lot of buzz around Teen Spirit, which stars Elle Fanning as a shy Isle Of Wight teenager who enters an X Factor-style music contest. After its premiere in Toronto, Deadline said the film was \"reminiscent of a new-age Flashdance, only with the emphasis on singing instead of dancing\". Sir Elton's back catalogue will get an overhaul in Rocket Man - starring Taron Egerton as the bespectacled pianist; and directed by Dexter Fletcher, who rescued Bohemian Rhapsody from the scrap-heap when Bryan Singer was fired. And rounding out the year is Last Christmas, a romantic comedy inspired by Wham's holiday hit, which will also feature unreleased George Michael music.  End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Ones to watch for 2019 include Jade Bird, whose rip-roaring country-rock songs have lit up playlists on both sides of the Atlantic; and 17-year-old Billie Eilish, who currently gets 24 million monthly listeners on Spotify for her ominous tales of angst and obsession. Tyneside's Sam Fender has already won the Brits Critics' Choice Award for his emotionally-charged indie rock (check out Dead Boys, which tackles the issue of male suicide) while the longlist for the BBC's Sound of 2019 includes flamenco star Rosal\u00eda, R&B singer Ella Mai and queer pop songwriter King Princess. The winner will be revealed on 11 January. Nominations for the Brit Awards are announced a day later - with George Ezra locked on for best male and best album for Staying At Tamara's, the UK's best-selling new release of 2018. Arctic Monkeys, Clean Bandit and Florence + The Machine should also grab a nomination or two. At the Grammys, British star Dua Lipa is a frontrunner for best new artist, while Kacey Musgraves could be the first country act to win album of the year since 2010. Elsewhere, Childish Gambino, Cardi B, Janelle Monae and Drake all have multiple shots at the night's big prizes. But the biggest question mark hanging over the music industry in 2019 is the impact of Brexit.  How will the visa situation affect touring musicians? Will there be a price hike for vinyl and CDs, which are largely manufactured in Europe? And will Damon Albarn be forced to write another album about the political fallout?

Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus all had their troubles but managed to escape the year without seeing their brands trashed in quite the same way as their parent. So, it's no surprise to see articles related to Facebook's various scandals secured it three of the spots in BBC Tech's most-read stories list for 2018. Two other controversy magnets - Elon Musk and Huawei - however, narrowly missed out.  And for the first time since we started compiling this list in 2012, none of the placings went to a product launch. Below are the most clicked on articles for each month of the year - a mix of controversy, endeavour and sparkly revenge. January: Chipocalypse Now Software flaws have long been a bane of computing, but when news emerged of serious vulnerabilities in popular processor chips there was a serious intake of breath from the cyber-security community. Billions of PCs, smartphones and other devices were said to be susceptible to the Meltdown and Spectre bugs - including, as it emerged, Apple's products. At one point there was talk of owners having to brace themselves for their machines feeling noticeably more sluggish as a result of the workarounds that would be needed, or even needing to send their computers in for component swap-outs. A year on, there doesn't appear to have been any malware related to the flaws reported in the wild, even though further variants of the originally disclosed exploits have been discovered.  And as far as personal computers are concerned, the patches released don't appear to have caused much of a hit to performance. February: Fake porn Deepfakes gave the internet something else to worry about in February, after it emerged that free software meant anyone could replace the face of one person with another's in video footage so long as you had enough photos of the latter. Inevitably, the tool was used to create pornography with a range of predominantly young female celebrities' features generated to supplant those of the original adult actresses. One after another websites lined up to ban the content until Reddit, which had been home to much of it, decided to do likewise. As the algorithms involved have improved, there has been much discussion about the danger of fake news creators adopting the face-mapping technique  to create bogus videos of politicians. But there's another worrying trend.  It appears that some Deepfakers are attempting to scrape social media for images of acquaintances that they can turn into pornography, and have been sharing details of their progress in chat forums. March: Cambridge Analytica Donald Trump's election in 2016 helped put Cambridge Analytica in the public eye after reports that its psychological profiles of US voters had helped his campaign target messages. But the London-based consultancy only became a household name after a report in the Observer explained how the firm had made use of millions of harvested Facebook accounts' details, while a follow-up Channel 4 TV report recorded the consultancy's chief on tape discussing how beautiful girls could be sent to a politician's house  as a honey-trap. Facebook also found itself in the firing line. It didn't help itself by first trying to suppress the story and then quibbling over whether it warranted being described as a \"data breach\". Yesterday @facebook threatened to sue us. Today we publish this. Meet the whistleblower blowing the lid off Facebook & Cambridge Analytica. https://t.co/QcuBJfBU5T End of Twitter post  by @carolecadwalla When Mark Zuckerberg did finally apologise several days later, he made a promise that has been repeatedly thrown back at him since. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he said. April: Scandal grows By early April, Facebook was estimating that up to 87 million of its members' details had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. More than a million of them were thought to belong to UK-based users.  This was based on the number of accounts that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - had harvested from the social network via a personality quiz. Soon after, Cambridge Analytica responded that its parent, SCL Elections, had in fact \"only\" licensed 30 million people's records from Dr Kogan, and all, it said, had been from US citizens. That wasn't enough to save it - the political consultancy folded in May. But it now forms part of Facebook's defence against a fine from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which was imposed despite the watchdog acknowledging that it had found no evidence that UK citizens' data had been passed to Cambridge Analytica. The \u00a3500,000 amount is peanuts to the social network - it makes more in half an hour, and the reputational damage it has incurred has arguably been far more costly. But Facebook is concerned that the penalty could set a precedent for other data regulators to follow. May: RIP TotalBiscuit The British video games critic John \"TotalBiscuit\" Bain had first told his fans and wider following that he had cancer in 2015. By April 2018 the 33-year-old had announced he was retiring from journalism as the medication he was on was preventing him from thinking clearly. Even so, his death shocked and saddened many of his 2.2 million YouTube fans when it was confirmed. The obituaries that followed mostly focused on how he had championed indie games and criticised some of their bigger-budgeted rivals, which he had said sometimes prioritised profit over all else.  But on social media and in some later articles, there was criticism of the role Mr Bain had played in the GamerGate movement. It was claimed he had given legitimacy to a misogynistic campaign that had been responsible for the harassment of others.  But this in turn spurred on his supporters to defend his legacy. They said his involvement had been mischaracterised and noted that Mr Bain had called for ethics in games journalism for several years before GamerGate existed. June: Data from the deep The phrase \"the cloud\" conjures up images of our data being stored in some nebulous form high above us. In reality, tech firms are investing billions of pounds in racks of computer servers housed in gigantic data centres across the globe to power the apps we use and internet services we call on. For the most part, these are built at ground-level. But in June, Microsoft sank an experimental data centre into the sea off Orkney in the north of Scotland. The idea is to reduce cooling costs by keeping the equipment in a sealed vault underwater. The tech giant intends to monitor Project Natick for five years to see if the scheme is a practical proposition for a wider rollout. But elsewhere, Google revealed it had already made the switch to liquid-cooling to tackle the heat given off by its latest artificial intelligence-focused computer servers. But rather than dropping its equipment overboard, it is piping coolant to each chip. July: Thoughtless threat PayPal was guilty of a major faux pas when it wrote to Lindsay Durdle, one of its recently deceased customers, to say her death was a breach of its rules. To make matters worse, it added that it might take legal action as a consequence. Her husband Howard Durdle was appalled, and to be fair so was PayPal's PR team when the BBC brought the matter to its attention. Although the firm was unable to confirm exactly what had gone wrong it attempted to make good on the situation by writing off a debt his wife had owed. \"PayPal have been in touch, have apologised sincerely and have promised to change whatever they need to internally to ensure this can't happen again,\" Mr Durdle tweeted after the BBC's article was published. \"I just hope more organisations can apply empathy and common sense to avoid hurting the recently bereaved.\" August: Mystery satellite As official statements go, the US State Department's wasn't the most reassuring: \"We don't know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it.\" The subject was a Russian satellite that had been launched 10 months earlier and was displaying abnormal behaviour.  One US official suggested it could be a space weapon designed to destroy other satellites - an allegation a Russian diplomat slammed as being \"unfounded [and] slanderous\". For those who track such developments, the US's suspicions echoed those raised about another Russian launch four years earlier when what was thought to be a bit of debris started zipping about in orbit. In any case, at the end of the year we are officially none the wiser about the objects true capabilities.  But with the Trump administration pursuing its own plan to create a Space Force by 2020, off-planet militarisation looks set to remain a hot topic. September: Facebook flaw With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still ratting along, Facebook revealed that a separate problem had exposed almost 50 million accounts to being hijacked. The cause was a vulnerability in the code of its View As privacy facility, which was designed to let users see what their profile looked like to others. At the time, Facebook said it was \"temporarily turning off\" the tool while it conducted a review. Three months on, it remains disabled. The firm did, however, revise its estimate down to 30 million accounts. While we're on the topic, here's some of Facebook's other controversies in 2018: In an end of year message posted yesterday, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had become much more \"proactive\" at addressing the challenges it faced but warned some problems could \"never be fully solved\". But overall, he said he was \"proud of the progress\" Facebook had made in 2018. October: Power struggle Many of us have experienced the sinking feeling that comes from leaving the home in the morning to discover your smartphone battery never recharged overnight. Typically, it's a case of failing to properly plug the handset in. But a YouTuber's tests of the latest iPhones indicated some of the new devices only topped up their power if their displays were \"woken up\" first.  Inevitably this was dubbed \"chargegate\",  and when the BBC published its take on the issue Apple had yet to comment. But a week later, when it released the next version of its mobile operating system, Apple's accompanying notes confirmed it had fixed a bug that had caused the flaw. November: #Dontbeevil At the start of the year the Time's Up movement was founded to take a stand against sexual assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace. It was a response to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein but also marked an effort to tackle problems faced by women more widely. Eleven months later, seven of Google's employees declared \"time's up\" on the tech giant after accusations of misconduct emerged involving two past male high-fliers as well as dozens of other staff. As a result, workers at Google's offices across the world staged a series of walkouts. Managers were delivered a set of demands, including a call to end the firm's requirement that sexual harassment disputes be dealt with internally. About a week later, Google's chief Sundar Pichai confirmed that the business would indeed stop its policy of forced arbitration, opening the door to it being sued over the matter in the future. December: Glitter bomb The internet fell in love with a revenge prank staged by an ex-Nasa engineer earlier this month. After having a package stolen from his porch, Mark Rober constructed a \"bomb\" that married a centrifugal motor, lots of glitter, fart spray and several smartphones. He then hid the device within an Apple Homepod speaker box and left it on his porch. When thieves subsequently stole it, it recorded the moment it sprayed them with its contents. After which, Mr Rober retrieved the package and repeated the exercise. In an ideal world, the story would have ended there, with Mr Rober's YouTube fame assured thanks to the compilation video he made. But a couple of days after uploading the footage,  the inventor replaced the video with a shorter edit. Some viewers had voiced suspicions about parts of the footage, and Mr Rober acknowledged that when he had chased up their concerns he had discovered that one of his helpers had recruited acquaintances to pose as two of the five featured thieves. An important note: pic.twitter.com/9MgQFVbhoB End of Twitter post  by @MarkRober \"I'm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn't just taint the entire effort as 'fake',\" he tweeted. Most viewers seem to have been forgiving, but it's unfortunate that what was a fun stunt might cause many to be more suspicious and cynical about what they see online in the future.

Ministers hope to begin negotiating deals with key partners once the UK leaves the EU in March and start implementing them from 2021 onwards. The International Trade Committee said MPs must have a \"meaningful role\" in ratifying deals, with scrutiny at an early stage and a decisive final vote. The government is not obliged to give Parliament a vote on treaties it signs. However, ministers bowed to pressure and agreed to give MPs a vote on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU which, if the Commons approves it next month, will take the form of a treaty. Theresa May faces an uphill struggle getting the agreement through the Commons, having postponed the crucial vote earlier this month in the face of what looked like a heavy defeat. Many Tory MPs are concerned that the agreement will keep the UK indefinitely tied to EU rules and regulations, and hamper its ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US and Canada. US President Donald Trump has questioned the value of a future trade deal with the UK if it is not able to alter its tariffs and regulations.  But, at the same time, campaigners have warned that the UK may be forced to water down food safety, consumer protection and environmental standards to reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners.  MPs are calling for Parliament to be given an enhanced role in considering future trade agreements once the UK regains the power to negotiate its own deals. The cross-party committee is urging the government to operate from a \"presumption of transparency rather than secrecy\" in negotiating the UK's post-Brexit trade policy. Its new report suggests MPs debate a substantive, amendable motion before negotiations are under way, once the government has agreed an outline approach - allowing Parliament to express its \"concerns or objections\", and lowering the risk of it rejecting eventual negotiated agreements. The committee also recommends that the government hold regular consultations with interested parties, such as businesses, to enable them to share their opinions while the devolved administrations should have a statutory role in the process. The SNP's Angus MacNeil, who chairs the committee, said the government's current plans for Parliamentary input were \"characteristically vague\". \"Our report makes an unequivocal argument for transparency over secrecy, consultation over concealment, and parliamentary debate over simple rubber-stamping,\" he said. \"If the proper processes and protections are not put in place from the outset, the government may fail to realise the UK-wide post-Brexit benefits it has gone to such lengths to promote.\" A Department for International Trade spokesperson said it had been \"very clear that we will not lower food standards as part of any new free trade agreement\". ", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44532500", "content": "The UK will be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. The warrant allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. The UK wants to stay part of the system when it leaves the EU next March. But Mr Barnier said the UK could not, because of its desire to leave the EU's court and free movement scheme. The EU would consider setting up a \"streamlined\" extradition process with the UK instead, said Mr Barnier. His words are not likely to go down well with the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, who earlier this month singled the European Arrest Warrant out as one of the cornerstones of post-Brexit security co-operation with the EU. He said it had \"brought dangerous people swiftly to justice\" and \"played a crucial role in supporting police co-operation, not least in Northern Ireland and Ireland\". Mr Barnier said \"facts have consequences\" and the UK's decision to leave the EU and its single market meant things could not stay the way they were now. He said the UK's decision to opt out of free movement rules and largely end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice \"means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant\". He suggested it would not be \"fair\" for the UK to keep all the benefits of EU membership.  \"They want to maintain all the benefits of the current relationship, while leaving the EU regulatory, supervision, and application framework,\" he said.  \"And they try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It would mean wasting time we don't have.\" Mr Barnier said that aside from the European Court of Justice the arrest warrant was also underpinned by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by the concept of EU citizenship. He added: \"Today we know that the UK is not ready to accept the free movement of people, the jurisdiction of the court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights - for the charter, this was confirmed last week by the House of Commons. \"This means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant.\" The EU's remaining 27 countries would continue to share information from passenger name records and the UK would not have automatic access to EU-only police databases or those of countries in the Schengen zone, he said in a speech in Vienna. Similarly, while the UK would be shown analysis done by Europol relating to live criminal investigations, it would not be able to \"shape the direction\" of the EU's law enforcement agency or other EU bodies. Shared efforts to counter money-laundering and terrorist finance must continue, Mr Barnier said, but judicial co-operation in criminal matters could not extend to continued membership of the European Arrest Warrant. Successive UK governments have remained strong supporters of the European Arrest Warrant - which came into force in 2004 - despite calls from some Tory MPs for it to be renegotiated or reformed.  According to the National Crime Agency, other EU members requested the arrest of 14,279 UK-based suspects in 2015-6, up from 1,865 in 2004. The UK made 241 such requests in 2015-6, leading to 150 arrests. Speaking at the same event as Mr Barnier, leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt said \"solutions were possible\" to ensure public safety was not compromised by Brexit but he made clear the status quo was not an option. \"They cannot be simply based on continuing the same processes as before,\" he said.  In response, the Department for Exiting the European Union said protecting the public was an \"absolute priority\".  \"Any drop in the breadth and quality of co-operation would have a direct impact on public safety and on our collective ability to deliver justice across Europe,\" a spokesman said.  Earlier this year the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said non-participation in the scheme was \"probably the biggest practical vulnerability\" facing law enforcement in Northern Ireland post-Brexit. George Hamilton told a House of Lords committee there would be \"very real operational consequences if there are no alternative arrangements in place around exchange of material and people by way of a European arrest warrant\".", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46600850", "content": "The cabinet has decided to \"ramp up\" preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid uncertainty over the fate of Theresa May's proposed EU exit deal.  It allocated to ministries \u00a32bn set aside in case the UK leaves on 29 March without MPs having accepted any deal. Letters will be sent to 140,000 firms updating them on what they should do while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to help government departments.  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it amounted to \"psychological warfare\". With 101 days left until Brexit and many MPs still opposed to the government's withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on in mid-January, ministers met for a longer-than-normal two and a half hour meeting. They agreed that businesses should activate their own no deal contingency plans, as they think appropriate. Updated Revenue and Customs information packs will be sent to firms later this week, setting out what changes could be needed at the border.  Consumers are being advised to familiarise themselves with advice published this summer, in areas ranging from booking flights to using credit cards, with more details promised in the coming weeks.  Please upgrade your browser The Treasury said \u00a3480m of the \u00a32bn of preparation funding would go to the Home Office, helping it to employ more Border Force officers and boost national security. Defra would receive \u00a3410m, allowing it to focus on ensuring the trade in fish, food products and chemicals remains uninterrupted.  HMRC, which is being allocated \u00a3375m, plans to hire more than 3,000 new staff to handle increases in customs activities, as well as investing in new technology at borders. The next largest allocations will be \u00a3190m for the Department for Business and \u00a3128m for the Department for International Trade. Separately, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs that 3,500 military personnel, including logisticians and engineers as well as infantry units, were ready to be deployed if needed. About 10% of the force would be reservists who will receive their call up papers in the middle of January so that if needed they would be ready in March.  In other developments: Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the cabinet had agreed that \"preparing for a no deal will be an operational priority within government but our overall priority is to secure a deal\". He said no-deal planning \"needs to be much more of a priority for businesses\" and there would be a \"significant increase\" in the guidance issued to them over the next 14 weeks, as Brexit day approaches. E-mails will be sent out to 80,000 of those businesses most like to be affected over the next few days. In the autumn of 2017, The Treasury earmarked \u00a33bn for no-deal planning between 2018 and 2020.  In March, Chancellor Philip Hammond said half of that had been allocated to 20 government departments, with the Home Office, transport, the environment and business among the largest recipients.  At Tuesday's cabinet meeting ministers approved the second tranche - plus an under-spend from the current year - to go to departments for the 2019/20 year, with the priority areas being borders, security and international trade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already ordered full \"no deal\" planning across the National Health Service, he told the BBC's Newsnight on Monday. But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, criticised UK ministers, who he said were \"glorifying\" the prospect of leaving without a comprehensive deal in the hope individual agreements could be reached in areas like transport and livestock movements.  Those, like Jeremy Hunt, who glorify a no\u2013deal #Brexit are totally irresponsible. It is not the job of politicians to make the people they lead poorer, remove opportunities, rights & make lives more uncertain. There is no such thing as a \"managed no deal\". https://t.co/f1sPT4R2KS End of Twitter post  by @guyverhofstadt And Labour said a no-deal exit was \"not viable\" and it would work with other parties to stop it. \"It is testament to the prime minister's failure in these negotiations that the government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table,\" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. And the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for another referendum, said the government was \"attempting to scare\" MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal. \"Theresa May is irresponsibly trying to run down the clock so that the only option is to support her discredited deal,\" Sir Vince Cable said.  MPs will vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations, in the middle of January. The deal will only come into force if both the UK and European parliaments approve it. The BBC understands Mrs May is planning to use the Commons vote as a \"moment of reckoning\" for the Brexit process.  Sources have told the BBC that Downing Street will not stand in the way of MPs who seek to amend the government's motion on the Brexit deal to put forward potential alternatives.  The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to push for a further vote of no-confidence in the government as a whole. On Monday night, the Labour leader tabled a motion calling on MPs to declare they have no confidence in the prime minister because she failed to have a vote on her Brexit deal straight away. No 10 has refused to make time for the motion and Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed on Tuesday that there were under no obligation to do so.  Other parties - the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - have called on Mr Corbyn to push for a no-confidence vote against the government as a whole. Unlike a vote aimed at the prime minister, the government would have to allow a vote on this motion and, if successful, it could force a general election. Northern Ireland's DUP, whose votes the Conservative government has relied on in big votes since the June 2017 election, said they would not support Labour.  Mrs May also appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader.  One of them, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would never vote against Mrs May or a Conservative government. He said on Tuesday evening that he had a \"civilised and courteous\" meeting with the PM, and that the government was \"prudent\" to engage in no-deal planning.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45325701", "content": "Theresa May has announced plans to boost Britain's investment in Africa after Brexit, during her first trip to the continent as prime minister. In a speech in Cape Town, she pledged \u00a34bn in support for African economies, to create jobs for young people. She also pledged a \"fundamental shift\" in aid spending to focus on long-term economic and security challenges rather than short-term poverty reduction. She will also visit Nigeria and Kenya during the three-day trade mission. On her way to South Africa, the prime minister played down warnings from the chancellor about the economic damage a no-deal Brexit could cause. Talking to journalists on board RAF Voyager on Tuesday morning, Mrs May reiterated that she believed a no-deal Brexit was still better than a bad deal - adding no-deal \"wouldn't be the end of the world\". Last week Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in a letter that a no-deal Brexit could damage the economy.  Mrs May's trip - which will see her meet the presidents of all three countries - aims to deepen economic and trade ties with growing African economies ahead of Britain leaving the EU in 2019. Arriving in South Africa on Tuesday morning, Mrs May said she wanted the UK to overtake the US to become the G7's biggest investor in Africa by 2022. She promised to continue existing economic links based on the UK's EU membership - including an EU-wide partnership with the Southern African Customs Union and Mozambique - after Brexit next year.  Promising an extra \u00a34bn in direct UK government investment - which she expects to be matched by the private sector - she said while the UK could not match the \"economic might\" of some foreign investors - such as China or the US - it offered long-term opportunities of the \"highest quality and breadth\".  She defended the UK's aid spending in Africa, a target of criticism from some Tory MPs, saying it had \"worked\" to give millions of children and women an education and immunise millions against deadly diseases. But she said she was \"unashamed\" that it had to work in the UK's own interest and pledged a new approach in future, focusing on helping British private sector companies invest in fast-growing countries like Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal while \"bolstering states under threat\" from Islamist extremism such as Chad, Mali and Niger.  \"True partnerships are not about one party doing unto another, but states, governments, businesses and individuals working together in a responsible way to achieve common goals,\" she said. The UK's overseas aid budget totalled \u00a313.9bn in 2017, an increase of \u00a3555m in 2016. UK direct investment in Africa was \u00a342.7bn in 2016, compared with \u00a344.3bn from the US, \u00a338bn from France and \u00a331bn from China, according to data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By BBC News reporter Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg Theresa May is on a charm offensive. This is the first visit by a UK prime minister to South Africa in five years - the last visit was by David Cameron when he came for Nelson Mandela's memorial in 2013. But this trip was prompted by Brexit, as with the UK leaving the European Union next year, it needs to strengthen its trade agreements around the world. Mrs May's address to business leaders was peppered with flattery about the continent's potential, as well as noting concerns about challenges around security and poverty, and she promised a mutually beneficial relationship. But some say the UK is late to the trade party, with countries like China already having firm trade partnerships across Africa. Africa is changing, re-imagining itself and rejecting the label of the \"dark continent\". Many in South Africa, and indeed across the continent, will be keen to see how the UK, which has at times been criticised for being too focused on aid rather than trade, demonstrates its shift to seeing the continent as an equal partner at the table. Mrs May said national self-interest and global co-operation were not in conflict and the UK could play a key role in harnessing the \"innovation and creativity\" of young people in Africa, 60% of whose population is under the age of 25.  \"The challenges facing Africa are not Africa's alone,\" she said. \"It is the world's interest to see these jobs created.\" Lord Boateng, chair of the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, praised the government's \"proactive spirit\" at making more opportunities for British business on the continent, but said the UK was \"late to the party\". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One:  \"The reality is that the Chinese, the French, the Indians, indeed Korea, Japan, Germany even, tend to have had a much more proactive response to business in Africa than we traditionally have had.  \"We have a lot of catching up to do if we are to make the most of what is an historic opportunity to recast the relationship between Africa and the UK away from it being seen solely as a philanthropic exercise, a basket case suitable only for [oversees aid], to an opportunity that requires investment, that requires risk taking and support by government for British companies.\" Sharon Constancon, chair of the South African Chamber of Commerce in London, said the UK's aims were ambitious given that it currently ranked seventh and eighth respectively in terms of exports and imports to South Africa, the continent's largest economy. During talks with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mrs May said she raised the issue of his government's controversial land reform program, which has been criticised by US President Donald Trump - who last week claimed that white farmers were being murdered and their property expropriated. The UK PM said she supported measures that were legal, transparent and had democratic approval, welcoming Mr Ramaphosa's assurances there would be \"no smash and grab\" seizures of land.  By Larry Madowo, BBC Africa business editor The UK's historical relationship with many African countries still counts for something, but, as Prime Minister Theresa May will find on her trip to the continent, the UK now vies for attention with larger economies offering greater riches. The continent's leaders need to decide who to prioritise: an ambitious but friendly China, the huge European Union bloc, the potential riches of the United States, or the historically-linked United Kingdom.  The prime minister's trip comes a week before the huge Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. Dozens of African heads of state are expected there and China may offer new trade and finance deals. Mrs May's trip seems rather low key in comparison. Tuesday - Mrs May flew into Cape Town where she met young people, before delivering a keynote speech on trade and how UK private sector investment could be brought into Africa. After a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, she visited Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. She had a guided tour and was handed a key to open the cell Mr Mandela was imprisoned in, before writing in the guestbook: \"His legacy lives on in the hopes and dreams of young people here in South Africa and around the world.\" Wednesday - Mrs May intends to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital Abuja before meeting victims of modern slavery in Lagos. Thursday - In Kenya, Mrs May will meet president Uhuru Kenyatta before visiting British troops and a business school. A state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta will conclude the trip.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43314976", "content": "Donald Tusk has insisted the EU \"does not want to build a wall\", but Brexit means \"we will be drifting apart\". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to \"demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success\", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveiling draft guidelines for the EU side of Brexit trade talks. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an \"ambitious and advanced\" free trade deal - and continued access to UK waters for EU fishing vessels. \"Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother,\" he said. \"It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit.\" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would \"loosen, not strengthen, economic ties\". The draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods - where the EU has a surplus. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be \"no cherry-picking\" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the \"narrow negotiating mandate set out in these guidelines suggests that the EU doesn't think it will be much more ambitious than other free trade agreements it has negotiated - Canada is the most obvious example\". Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. But he added: \"No member state is free to pick only those sectors of the internal market they like, or to accept the role of the ECJ only when it suits their interest.\" The draft guidelines also say that the EU will \"preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies\".  Mrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an \"off-the-shelf\" model. \"The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,\" she said. \"If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking.\" She also said: \"We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies.\" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The EU says it wants to maintain \"existing reciprocal access to fishing waters\" - a leading concern of the fishing industry in countries bordering the North Sea. In her Mansion House speech, Mrs May said: \"The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters.\" She added that the UK would want to \"work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry\". Brexit Secretary David Davis - quizzed on Tuesday by Brexiteer Labour MP Kate Hoey - insisted the government would not betray UK fishing communities by \"trading away fishing rights\" for \"other things\". Asked about the EU's demand to keep access as it is now, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK was \"open to discussing with our EU partners about the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal access for our fishermen to EU waters and for EU fishermen to our waters\". Campaign group Fishing for Leave urged the government not to \"cave in\" to the EU demands, saying: \"Nowhere else is access to fisheries included as negotiating collateral for a free trade agreement.\" Financial services are not mentioned specifically in the EU draft guidelines, but it is shaping up to be a major sticking point. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. \"Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU 27, it's hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement,\" he said in a speech. \"Not only is it possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but this is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" But Donald Tusk appeared to reject the UK proposals. The EU says the UK will be treated like any other \"third country\" after Brexit. Asked about the EU guidelines, which also warn of the \"negative economic consequences\" of Brexit, Mr Hammond said: \"It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do.\" EU deal 'must include financial services' Donald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg.  A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services.  I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK.  But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines.  The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice.  MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43189878", "content": "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed the UK being in a permanent customs union with the EU in a speech setting out his approach to Brexit. He said this would avoid the need for a \"hard border\" in Northern Ireland and ensure free-flowing trade for business. The policy shift could lead to Labour siding with Tory rebels to defeat Theresa May on her Brexit strategy. But a customs union after Brexit would be a \"complete sell out\", International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will argue. Mr Corbyn insisted in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg that his speech was a \"firming up\" of Labour's existing policy, which was to back customs union membership during the planned two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. In his speech, at Coventry University, Mr Corbyn said Labour would be \"looking for a Brexit that puts the working people first\". In a shift from the party's policy at last year's general election, he said the UK should strike a new customs deal with the EU at the end of transition.   \"Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union,\" he said. \"We have long argued that a customs union is a viable option for the final deal.  \"So Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland.\" The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave both the single market and the customs union, allowing it to negotiate its own post-Brexit trade deals. Mrs May will give details in a speech on Friday of how her plan for a \"managed diversion\" from the EU will work in practice, after first briefing the cabinet.  The Conservatives accused Mr Corbyn of \"betraying millions of Labour voters\" who had backed Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Labour's \"confused policy would be bad for jobs and wages\".  And in a speech on Tuesday, he will say the UK would find itself in a \"worse position\" than it is now if it leaves the existing customs union but negotiates a similar arrangement. A customs union allows free-flowing trade between member nations without making companies pay export taxes, or tariffs, at the border.  However, the members normally have joint trade agreements with countries not in their customs union.   A single market is a deeper form of co-operation, which effectively merges the economies of member states together, allowing the free movement of goods, services, money and people as if they were part of a single country. Mr Corbyn rejected calls from pro-EU figures like Lord Mandelson and a number of his own backbenchers to commit to staying in the EU single market, saying instead that he wanted a \"close relationship\" with it. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out continuing with free movement of people between the UK and the EU in some form after Brexit, under Labour's plans, but he told BBC News it would have to be negotiated - as would any financial contribution the UK would make. He said the UK could work \"jointly\" with the EU after Brexit to strike trade deals with other nations - something the government insists is not possible. Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ian Watson  So the dividing lines are clear politically - if less clear in practice. Clear politically, because the government is committed to coming out of the customs union. And in contrast Labour now says it wants to negotiate \"a new comprehensive customs union\" with the EU. That puts clear blue water between opposition and government - and may signal to Remain voters that Labour wants a 'softer' Brexit, staying closer to the EU.  But in practice, there may be fewer differences than meets the eye.  Jeremy Corbyn wants a customs union that would still give the UK a say in EU-led trade deals - which the EU may resist. And Theresa May has spoken of a new \"customs arrangement,\" which would, er, allow independent trade deals.  But it's currently in the government and opposition's political interests to emphasise the differences,  not the similarities.  Jeremy Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether his policy shift was an attempt to remove Theresa May from office and force a general election. Tory rebels have been tight-lipped about whether they would vote against Mrs May if it came down to a confidence vote in her premiership, saying that was unlikely to happen.  But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Leave and said Mr Corbyn was once more Eurosceptic than him, told the BBC that being in a customs union or the single market would be a \"deceit\" and dismissed suggestions Tory rebels could join with Labour to defeat the government as \"fairy tales\" and they would win any vote by a large majority. Mr Corbyn was an opponent of the EU when he was a backbench Labour MP, as he explained in his speech. \"I have long opposed the embedding of free market orthodoxy and the democratic deficit in the European Union, and that is why I campaigned to 'remain and reform' in the referendum campaign.\" He said scepticism was \"healthy\" but \"often the term 'Eurosceptic' in reality became synonymous with 'anti-European' and I am not anti-European at all, I want to see close and progressive cooperation with the whole of Europe after Brexit\". He said this \"new relationship\" he wanted to negotiate with the EU would ensure Labour could deliver on its plans to nationalise public utilities, invest in industry and curb the outsourcing of public services. Mr Corbyn's speech was welcomed by Britain's largest trade unions while industry body, the CBI, said staying in a customs union would \"grow trade without accepting freedom of movement or payments to the EU\".  Pro-European Labour MPs said he had not gone far enough and urged him to commit to staying in the single market. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was the \"first step in a complete Labour sell-out\" while the DUP, the party Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, said it was \"cheap political opportunism\". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable tweeted that Mr Corbyn's customs union stance was a \"small step to sanity\", but added: \"In #SingleMarket he is still following @theresa-may cake and eat it policy. Just wants red cherries rather than blue raisins.\"", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46195282", "content": "EE has announced which six UK cities will be the first to get faster 5G mobile networks. Building on existing trials, EE will turn on 5G in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Birmingham and Manchester by mid-2019. By the end of 2019, another 10 cities will get EE networks which could transmit data at speeds faster than 10 gigabits per second. Other UK networks are now trialling 5G to accelerate their rollout next year. When 5G networks are operating, Britons can expect higher speeds and better reliability, said Marc Allera, head of the consumer division at EE-owner BT, in a statement.  \"We have an ambition to connect our customers to 4G, 5G or wi-fi 100% of the time,\" said Mr Allera. He suggested that customers would \"pay a little more\" for 5G because of its speed and responsiveness. The other 10 cities will be Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester, Coventry and Bristol. Vodafone, O2 and Three are all running trials of the futuristic network technology and are using these as a test bed while they develop services. In early November, Three said it was well into work to prepare its network for 5G by boosting capacity and installing hardware that will work with existing and faster, future networks. Vodafone said its trial in Manchester was now part of its \"commercial network\" and similar sites in five other cities would soon start. It has given no date for when it would offer a 5G service. O2's test systems are based around the O2 arena in London and it is also running other trials in locations around the UK. It has written to every company in the UK FTSE 100 inviting them to join tests of how the new mobile tech could help their businesses. The announcement comes soon after the government wrote to UK telecoms firms warning those building 5G networks to take care when selecting which hardware they use.  The letter, reported in the Financial Times, said a review of hardware used for the UK's national infrastructure started in July could delay any rollout.  It said the review could place limits on how much equipment firms could use from Chinese electronics firm Huawei.

It said fellow communications firm ZTE had also been banned, both reportedly because of national security concerns. \"This is a extremely disappointing result for consumers,\" the company said on Twitter. Faster data download and upload speeds are promised with 5G, which is the next stage of mobile internet connectivity. Wider coverage and more stable connections than current 4G technology are also highlighted as benefits. Several countries are preparing for the roll-out of 5G mobile networks, although analysts say few will launch 5G services before 2020. Mark Newman, from the consultancy ConnectivityX, said: \"5G is going to be the next significant wave of mobile infrastructure deployment. \"If existing suppliers are banned, it will be quite a major blow for them.\" Huawei is the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment. It also ranks second in global smartphone sales, behind Samsung and ahead of Apple. In July, a UK security committee warned that it had \"only limited assurance\" that Huawei's telecoms kit posed no threat to national security. The UK's cyber-defence watchdog - the National Cyber Security Centre - has also warned that the use of ZTE's equipment and services could pose a national security risk. \"As we move into 5G, a greater proportion of the network is controlled by software,\" said Mr Newman. \"There is an argument that in this software realm, concerns about who is managing the network and where from are heightened.\"  On Thursday, the Australian government said national security regulations that were typically applied to telecoms firms would be extended to equipment suppliers. Companies that were \"likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government\" could present a security risk, it said. The United States has previously banned Huawei from bidding for government contracts because of fears over espionage. ZTE has also had its activity restricted in the US. Under Chinese law, companies must co-operate with the intelligence services. Analysts therefore warn that equipment produced by firms such as Huawei and ZTE could be compromised. China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Australia should not \"use various excuses to artificially erect barriers\". It called on Australia to \"abandon ideological prejudices and provide a fair competitive environment for Chinese companies\". Huawei has defended the security of its products. \"Huawei is a world leader in 5G,\" the company said in a statement.

Tesla's shares fell about 1.5% in early trade despite the Nasdaq, on which it trades, opening higher. Mr Musk has been embroiled in another Twitter-related controversy over recent weeks after tweeting that he was considering taking his car firm private, adding that he had secured the funds required. That caused major swings in the company's share price and subsequent claims that his message had been misleading. Mr Musk later said the firm would stay public. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is now reported to be investigating the matter, and some Tesla investors are suing the firm over the tweets. Mr Musk's latest tweet was written in response to a former journalist, who had accused him of hypocrisy. \"Your dedication to facts and truth would have been wonderful if applied to that time when you called someone a pedo,\" posted Drew Olanoff. In response, the tech entrepreneur not only questioned why Mr Unsworth had not taken him to court but also attacked Mr Olanoff for not carrying out his own investigation into the matter. \"So you actually did nothing and yet imply you are a truth-seeker,\" wrote Mr Musk. The US business leader had originally tweeted about Mr Unsworth in July. The two had been involved in a dispute over Mr Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help rescue schoolchildren trapped in a flooded cave network in Thailand. When questioned about this, the Briton had told CNN that the submarine was \"just a PR stunt [that] had absolutely no chance of working\". Mr Musk responded with a series of tweets, casting doubt on Mr Unsworth's character without providing supportive evidence. They culminated in a post that described Mr Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\" and a follow-up saying \"bet ya a signed dollar it's true\". Mr Unsworth subsequently said he might take legal action. The clash appeared to have been resolved after Mr Musk deleted his offending tweets. \"His actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologise to Mr Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader,\" Mr Musk tweeted on 18 July.

The first 30 customers - most of them employees of the company - received their cars on Friday. Chief executive Elon Musk said the Model 3 was the \"best car for its cost, either electric or gasoline\". Prices start at $35,000 (\u00a326,650), which the firm hopes will bring mass market interest.  The price is still higher than that of rival electric car the Nissan Leaf, which starts at $30,680, or the hybrid Chevrolet Volt, which goes for $34,095.  Past Tesla models, the \"S\" and \"X\", had a starting price of $80,000, putting them beyond the means of many. The company aims to produce 5,000 units of the Model 3 a week in 2017, and 10,000 a week by 2018. Buyers ordering now are being told to expect delivery late next year. More than half a million customers have already placed deposits. If Tesla can successfully produce and sell that many cars a year, it will outperform BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus in the US.

Sajid Javid is to chair talks in London later after agreeing a joint action plan with the French interior minister. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: \"The reasons behind the increased crossings are complicated and in many cases outside of our control.\" Since November, more than 220 people have attempted the journey.  Mr Javid has come under growing pressure to act, and cut short a family holiday in South Africa to address the issue. Following a call with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, the pair agreed an \"enhanced action plan\" to be put in place in the coming week. It includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing. The Home Office did not give information on how this would be done. Some MPs - including Conservative backbenchers - have criticised a lack of detail, as well as calling for more Border Force patrol boats to be deployed. Mr Javid said the complex factors behind the rise in numbers of people attempting the Channel crossing included instability in the Middle East, organised crime and tighter security at Calais.  He wrote: \"Unfortunately, this means that there are no easy answers. So our response is focused both here in the UK and abroad.\" He will chair a meeting with the Border Force, the National Crime Agency (NCA), Whitehall officials and other agencies on Monday morning to discuss what further action can be taken.  He added: \"While we have obligations to genuine asylum seekers... we will not stand by and allow reckless criminals to take advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in our global society.\" Currently, only one of the Border Force's fleet of five cutters - specialist boats which the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait.  Dover MP Charlie Elphicke has repeated calls for Border Force cutters to be called back from search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean to patrol the Channel. The Home Office has not said whether any of the other four cutters would return.  Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the armed forces were ready to offer help if needed. Six more Iranian men were found on a beach near Dover on Sunday morning. The NCA said French authorities prevented a further attempt to cross the Channel on Saturday night. However, compared with the number of refugees seeking asylum in the UK every year, the number who have attempted to cross the channel by dinghy is tiny, says BBC political correspondent Ben Wright. In 2017, 26,350 people applied for asylum, an average of about 2,200 a month. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet: \"We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety.\" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Mr Javid of exploiting the problem. She told the Guardian: \"There's no question that, with Brexit and also with the approach of the meaningful vote in January, people are being whipped up about migration issues, because the government thinks this is the best way of frightening people to vote for their deal.\"  Pierre-Henri Dumont, MP for Calais, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme smugglers were using \"the uncertainty of Brexit\" to \"spread fake news\" to migrants, telling them that this was the best time to attempt the crossing.

Mr Musk, however, has denied his use of the app was a distraction. \"I think sometimes people think I spend a lot of time in Twitter,\" he told the YouTuber Marques Brownlee earlier this month. \"Actually, it's like almost nothing. Most of my time is spent... going round the [Tesla] factory... and if I'm not here I'm at the Giga [battery] factory in Nevada.\" Mr Musk's younger brother - who is a board member of Tesla - defended his sibling's behaviour in a recent interview with the New York Times. \"The reason Elon seems to attract drama is that he is so transparent, so open, in a way that can come back to bite him,\" said Kimbal Musk. \"He doesn't know how to do it differently.\" But one leadership expert suggested some of Mr Musk's behaviour was unacceptable. \"Conventional business leaders are far more careful in their behaviour - you don't find FTSE 100 chief executives shooting from the hip like this because they are advised it would be detrimental to the interests of their companies,\" Matthew Gwyther, ex-editor of Management Today, told the BBC. \"But there can be a lack of humility that comes with being involved with big tech. \"If [the latest tweet] adversely affects the share price then Tesla's board members may feel duty bound to do something about it. \"But one way or the other, it's not the way you'd expect a person with that degree of power and responsibility to behave.\" ", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45445554", "content": "Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has smoked marijuana live on the web during a podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. Mr Rogan offered his guest the drug, which is legal in California, as the pair discussed tech innovation and the public's perception of Mr Musk. \"I mean, it's legal, right?\" asked the Tesla founder, before taking a drag on the joint. Tesla shares fell more than nine per cent following Mr Musk's appearance on the show. BBC business correspondent Kim Gittleson says the podcast appearance coupled with the departure of a key executive who blamed increasing public scrutiny of the company for his decision to leave has shaken investor confidence in Tesla. Last month, Mr Musk said he was not \"on weed\" when he tweeted about plans to make the electric car company a private firm. The business leader made the comments in an interview with the New York Times. He also told the newspaper he works \"120-hour weeks\" and takes sedatives. His controversial plans regarding Tesla's ownership were dropped about two weeks later, following outrage from some investors. Elon Musk has certainly had a wild summer. From his frequent tweet storms, to accusing a British rescue diver in Thailand of pedophilia, to a quick u-turn on an effort to take Tesla private - it's no wonder both investors and his closest friends have begun to worry. This latest incident certainly won't allay those concerns. But when it comes to Tesla, the erratic behaviour of Mr Musk might be the least of the company's problems. That's because the electric car maker has consistently struggled to hit its production targets, even as it's taken on more debt. Tesla has long been one of the most bet-against stocks on Wall Street. While that's something that has long frustrated Mr Musk, this certainly won't change that. Tesla's chief accounting officer Dave Morton said he had resigned after only one month in the role, citing \"the level of public attention placed on the company\" among his reasons. The firm's head of HR, Gaby Toledano, also announced she would not rejoin the company after a leave of absence.   During the podcast, Mr Rogan offered Mr Musk a joint, which he said contained a mix of tobacco and marijuana - dried leaves and flowering parts of the female cannabis plant. Of 50 US states, recreational cannabis remains illegal in 41 - but it was legalised in California, where the podcast was filmed, in January. \"Is that a cigar?\" asked Mr Musk when his host first proffered the joint. He later added that he \"almost never\" smoked marijuana, noting, \"I don't find that it is very good for productivity\". The pair also enjoyed whiskey during the podcast recording. Mr Musk pointed out: \"Alcohol's a drug.\" During their conversation, Mr Musk talked about his health and his management of Tesla - which he said was the most challenging of his various businesses and projects. To close the podcast, Mr Musk was asked if he had any concluding remarks. \"I think people should be nicer to each other,\" he said. \"And give\u2026 give more credit to others and don't assume they're mean until you know they're actually mean. \"It's easy to demonise people, you're usually wrong about it, people are nicer than you think.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46311192", "content": "As the year draws to a close, it is time to remember the figures from the worlds of arts and entertainment figures who died in 2018.

BT also confirmed that it was stripping out Huawei equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G networks, as revealed by the Financial Times (FT). Huawei faces security concerns. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission recently issued a report saying that Beijing could force Huawei and other Chinese 5G equipment-makers to \"modify products to perform below expectations or fail, facilitate state or corporate espionage, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability\" of networks that used them. Last week, New Zealand became the latest country to bar a local network from using Huawei's 5G gear.

BT has has long made use of Huawei's equipment within its fixed-line network, having signed a pioneering contract with the supplier in 2005. However, the BBC understands that BT introduced an internal policy a year later that restricted use of Huawei's equipment to the \"periphery\" of its infrastructure.  This kit is sometimes referred within the industry to being \"the dumb stuff at the end of the pipes\". It meant in theory that were Huawei's equipment to be compromised, some customers would be affected but the wider network would not collapse. In 2016, BT also acquired the mobile phone firm EE, which had been using the Shenzhen-based firm's kit to push about its customers' data. Shortly after, BT began removing Huawei equipment that it determined to be at the \"control plane\" - or core - of the network. Although this has been going on for two years, it was only publicly disclosed in response to a question by the FT. \"In 2016, following the acquisition of EE, we began a process to remove Huawei equipment from the core of our 3G and 4G networks, as part of network architecture principles in place since 2006,\" said a spokesman for BT. \"We're applying these same principles to our current RFP [request-for-proposal bid requests] for 5G core infrastructure.  \"As a result, Huawei has not been included in vendor selection for our 5G core.

Huawei has previously promoted its partnership with BT, and as recently as February issued a press release that said the two were working together on the \"development and live trials\" of 5G core network technologies. However, the BBC understands the Chinese firm did not expect to win any such contracts from BT and had been focused instead on selling 5G equipment for use elsewhere in its network. \"Since it acquired EE in 2016, the BT Group has been actively bringing EE's legacy network architecture in line with this long-standing agreement,\" said a spokesman for Huawei. \"This is a normal and expected activity, which we understand and fully support.  \"Working together, we have already completed a number of successful 5G trials across different sites in London, and we will continue to work with BT in the 5G era.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44891913", "content": "A UK government report into Huawei's broadband and mobile infrastructure equipment has concluded that it has \"only limited assurance\" that the kit poses no threat to national security The investigation revealed shortcomings in the Chinese firm's engineering processes, which it said \"have exposed new risks in UK telecoms networks\".

A spokesman for the firm added: \"We are grateful for this feedback and are committed to addressing these issues. \"Cyber-security remains Huawei's top priority, and we will continue to actively improve our engineering processes and risk management systems.\" Huawei is the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment and is a major supplier of broadband and mobile network gear in Britain. The report was written by the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), which was set up in 2010 in response to concerns that BT and others' use of the firm's equipment could pose a threat. The body is overseen by UK security officials, including ones from spy agency GCHQ. It said that it was disappointed that there had been a \"lack of progress\" in tackling previously identified shortcomings. Furthermore, it highlighted that a visit to Shenzhen in 2017 had revealed the company was failing to keep proper watch over the use of third-party components. \"[It was] identified that not all components are managed through this process and, in particular, security critical third-party software used in a variety of products was not subject to sufficient control,\" it said.

Australia is also considering banning the firm from being involved in its planned 5G network, over concerns that Beijing could force the firm to hand over sensitive data.

His decision forces a by-election in his constituency of Richmond Park, where he will stand as an independent. The Conservatives said they \"disagreed\" with Mr Goldsmith's decision but would not field a candidate against him. The MP and former London mayoral candidate has long campaigned against expanding Heathrow. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has ruled out any rethink of the policy to expand the airport. The Department for Transport says a new runway will benefit passengers and boost the wider economy by up to \u00a361bn, creating as many as 77,000 local jobs over the next 14 years. The Richmond Park by-election is expected to take place in December. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his party would be \"taking the fight\" to Mr Goldsmith and \"put huge pressure\" on the prime minister to abandon her Heathrow plans. Speaking at a school in his constituency, Mr Goldsmith said the contest would be a \"chance to send a message to government\". He said: \"I promised you if my party won the election, the third runway would be scrapped. And I wasn't making it up.\" He added: \"There was no small print, no expiry date, no ambiguity. It was a simple promise. And it mattered. I know it mattered, because the thought of Heathrow expansion fills most of my constituents with dread.\" Mr Goldsmith said the government had chosen the \"most polluting, most disruptive, most expensive option\" but it had \"also chosen the option with the least chance of being delivered\". He added: \"The sheer complexity, cost and legal difficulties mean it is unlikely ever to happen. It will be a millstone round this government's neck for years.\" But a Conservative spokesman said the government was \"taking decisive action in the national interest to secure the UK's place in the global aviation market - securing jobs and business opportunities for the next decade and beyond\". He added: \"That's why we have delivered on our manifesto commitment to respond to the Airports Commission's final report and have announced our support for the first full-length runway in the South East since the Second World War. \"We disagree with Zac about the need for a by-election in light of this decision, but understand his position. He has been a hard-working champion for the people of Richmond Park - as we know, he will continue to be if they re-elect him as their Member of Parliament - so we will not be putting up a candidate against him at this by-election.\" Earlier Mr Grayling told the House of Commons: \"The prime minister has been very clear that she does not want to force - and indeed I don't think the public would expect us to force - MPs with long-standing principles of disagreement over this to go against their own views.\" Mr Goldsmith held his south-west London seat in 2015 with a 23,015 majority.  The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010, finished second.  Mr Farron said the party was looking to \"build on our result\" in the recent Witney by-election, where it reduced the Conservative majority in David Cameron's former seat to 5,702 - down by more than 20,000 votes. He added: \"A victory for the Liberal Democrats would put huge pressure on Theresa May to abandon her plans for Heathrow expansion and an economically disastrous hard Brexit.\" His fellow Lib Dem, former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable, said there was a danger, if Mr Goldsmith stood \"with the support of the Conservatives but nominally independent\", of the by-election becoming a \"Zac Goldsmith ego-trip\".", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46712694", "content": "Dame June Whitfield - celebrated for her comic roles in BBC sitcom Terry and June and cult favourite Absolutely Fabulous - has died aged 93.

The bugs are an \"absolute disaster\" and need to be fixed promptly, according to one cyber-security researcher. Google researchers said one of the \"serious security flaws\", dubbed \"Spectre\", was found in chips made by Intel, AMD and ARM. The other, known as \"Meltdown\" affects Intel-made chips and one recent ARM chip. The industry has been aware of the problem for months and hoped to solve it before details were made public. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited. It has issued guidance about Meltdown and Spectre, including advice on what people can do to protect themselves. According to the researchers who found the bugs, chips dating as far back as 1995 have been affected. Some fixes, in the form of software updates known as patches, have been introduced or will be available in the next few days, said Intel, which provides chips to about 80% of desktop computers and 90% of laptops worldwide. \"These bugs are an absolute disaster,\" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House. While some computers can be patched quickly, others faced a longer wait, he explained, giving virtual hosting systems as one example. \"You may find that patches aren't yet available,\" he told the BBC. Microchips are the basic electronic systems behind many devices such as computers and mobile phones. In order to do their work, they must move data around, using different types of memory to temporarily store it. In many cases, that information is supposed to be secure from attempts to snoop on it, but these two bugs mean that it could in fact be accessed by a third party. The first reports suggested that a bug affected solely chips made by Intel, but it has since emerged that a separate flaw, Spectre, has been found in Intel, ARM and AMD chips.  \"Many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,\" said Intel.  ARM said patches had already been shared with its customers, which include many smartphone manufacturers. AMD said it believed there was \"near zero risk to AMD products at this time\". On a conference call for investors, Intel said researchers had shown that hackers could exploit the Meltdown vulnerability, gaining the ability to read memory and potentially access information such as passwords or encryption keys on devices. Microsoft, which uses Intel chips said it would roll out security updates on Thursday, adding it had no information suggesting any data had been compromised. Apple's latest macOS, version 10.13.2, is safe from the Meltdown bug and the firm is working on updates for earlier versions of the operating system on its laptops and desktops. As for Spectre, however, experts believe that it will not be possible to patch it directly, but various software tweaks could help stop it being exploited.  Google published a blog detailing what some customers may need to do.  It said Android phones with the latest security updates were protected, and that Gmail was safe. It will be releasing security patches for users of older Chromebooks, while there will also be a fix for users of the Chrome web browser. The NCSC said it was aware of the reports of the potential flaw and advised that all organisations and home users \"continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available.\" When asked whether hackers will make use of the bugs to attack computers, experts advised caution on the issue. \"It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43891933", "content": "The UK is considering plans to launch a satellite-navigation system as a rival to the EU's Galileo project.

Business Secretary Greg Clark is taking legal advice on whether the UK can reclaim the cash, according to the Financial Times. He told BBC News: \"The UK's preference is to remain in Galileo as part of a strong security partnership with Europe.  \"If Galileo no longer meets our security requirements and UK industry cannot compete on a fair basis, it is logical to look at alternatives.\"  The row centres around whether the UK can continue to be trusted with the EU's most sensitive security information after Brexit. The UK's armed forces were planning to use Galileo to supplement their use of the US GPS system, but press reports suggest they will now be blocked from doing so. The US retains the more accurate and robust GPS signals for its own armed forces. Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said early feasibility work was under way into a UK system, which he said would cost a \"lot less\" than Galileo, thanks to work already done and \"British know-how and ingenuity\".  Asked by the BBC's Science Correspondent Jonathan Amos if it could be as much as \u00a35bn, he said \"tops\". And he warned that excluding the UK from Galileo could set the European programme back years and cost the EU billions more in development costs. \"We still think there is a 'win win' to be had here if the European Commission and the EU 27 change their minds. \"But at the moment they appear to be set on excluding the UK from industrial participation in the programme.\" He said the UK had \"a lot of the capability that would be needed for a sat-nav system because we developed them as part of our role in Galileo\". \"We cannot launch yet, although obviously we are trying to address that, but this is something we think is in the realm of the credible,\" he added. The pan-European aerospace giant Airbus has been a major player in Galileo's development. And in the UK, Airbus currently controls the satellites in the sky - satellites that were also assembled by its subsidiary Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd in Guildford. While Airbus will be able to continue working on Galileo at its continental centres whatever the outcome of the present row, the company said its UK wing stood ready to assist in building a British sat-nav system if asked. \"If the UK opts for its own satellite-navigation system then Airbus's space operations in the UK has the skills and expertise to lead the development of it,\" Andrew Stroomer, a senior British executive in Airbus, told the BBC. Europe's Galileo system  Greg Clark warned that the European Commission's actions could threaten defence and security co-operation with Britain after it has left the EU. He is understood to be preparing to block the procurement of the next batch of Galileo satellites at a meeting of the European Space Agency council in Berlin, as part of a fightback against the EU decision. \"We've been clear that we do not accept the Commission's position and have called for a three-month procurement freeze and a clear commitment from the Commission that UK industry continues to be eligible to apply for all Galileo contracts on a fair and open basis,\" said the business secretary. Officials are also looking into whether the UK could refuse the EU access to ground stations in two British overseas territories - the Falkland Islands and the Ascension Islands.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44532500", "content": "The UK will be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. The warrant allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. The UK wants to stay part of the system when it leaves the EU next March. But Mr Barnier said the UK could not, because of its desire to leave the EU's court and free movement scheme. The EU would consider setting up a \"streamlined\" extradition process with the UK instead, said Mr Barnier. His words are not likely to go down well with the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, who earlier this month singled the European Arrest Warrant out as one of the cornerstones of post-Brexit security co-operation with the EU. He said it had \"brought dangerous people swiftly to justice\" and \"played a crucial role in supporting police co-operation, not least in Northern Ireland and Ireland\". Mr Barnier said \"facts have consequences\" and the UK's decision to leave the EU and its single market meant things could not stay the way they were now. He said the UK's decision to opt out of free movement rules and largely end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice \"means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant\". He suggested it would not be \"fair\" for the UK to keep all the benefits of EU membership.  \"They want to maintain all the benefits of the current relationship, while leaving the EU regulatory, supervision, and application framework,\" he said.  \"And they try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It would mean wasting time we don't have.\" Mr Barnier said that aside from the European Court of Justice the arrest warrant was also underpinned by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by the concept of EU citizenship. He added: \"Today we know that the UK is not ready to accept the free movement of people, the jurisdiction of the court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights - for the charter, this was confirmed last week by the House of Commons. \"This means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant.\" The EU's remaining 27 countries would continue to share information from passenger name records and the UK would not have automatic access to EU-only police databases or those of countries in the Schengen zone, he said in a speech in Vienna. Similarly, while the UK would be shown analysis done by Europol relating to live criminal investigations, it would not be able to \"shape the direction\" of the EU's law enforcement agency or other EU bodies. Shared efforts to counter money-laundering and terrorist finance must continue, Mr Barnier said, but judicial co-operation in criminal matters could not extend to continued membership of the European Arrest Warrant. Successive UK governments have remained strong supporters of the European Arrest Warrant - which came into force in 2004 - despite calls from some Tory MPs for it to be renegotiated or reformed.  According to the National Crime Agency, other EU members requested the arrest of 14,279 UK-based suspects in 2015-6, up from 1,865 in 2004. The UK made 241 such requests in 2015-6, leading to 150 arrests. Speaking at the same event as Mr Barnier, leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt said \"solutions were possible\" to ensure public safety was not compromised by Brexit but he made clear the status quo was not an option. \"They cannot be simply based on continuing the same processes as before,\" he said.  In response, the Department for Exiting the European Union said protecting the public was an \"absolute priority\".  \"Any drop in the breadth and quality of co-operation would have a direct impact on public safety and on our collective ability to deliver justice across Europe,\" a spokesman said.  Earlier this year the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said non-participation in the scheme was \"probably the biggest practical vulnerability\" facing law enforcement in Northern Ireland post-Brexit. George Hamilton told a House of Lords committee there would be \"very real operational consequences if there are no alternative arrangements in place around exchange of material and people by way of a European arrest warrant\".", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46600850", "content": "The cabinet has decided to \"ramp up\" preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid uncertainty over the fate of Theresa May's proposed EU exit deal.  It allocated to ministries \u00a32bn set aside in case the UK leaves on 29 March without MPs having accepted any deal. Letters will be sent to 140,000 firms updating them on what they should do while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to help government departments.  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it amounted to \"psychological warfare\". With 101 days left until Brexit and many MPs still opposed to the government's withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on in mid-January, ministers met for a longer-than-normal two and a half hour meeting. They agreed that businesses should activate their own no deal contingency plans, as they think appropriate. Updated Revenue and Customs information packs will be sent to firms later this week, setting out what changes could be needed at the border.  Consumers are being advised to familiarise themselves with advice published this summer, in areas ranging from booking flights to using credit cards, with more details promised in the coming weeks.  Please upgrade your browser The Treasury said \u00a3480m of the \u00a32bn of preparation funding would go to the Home Office, helping it to employ more Border Force officers and boost national security. Defra would receive \u00a3410m, allowing it to focus on ensuring the trade in fish, food products and chemicals remains uninterrupted.  HMRC, which is being allocated \u00a3375m, plans to hire more than 3,000 new staff to handle increases in customs activities, as well as investing in new technology at borders. The next largest allocations will be \u00a3190m for the Department for Business and \u00a3128m for the Department for International Trade. Separately, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs that 3,500 military personnel, including logisticians and engineers as well as infantry units, were ready to be deployed if needed. About 10% of the force would be reservists who will receive their call up papers in the middle of January so that if needed they would be ready in March.  In other developments: Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the cabinet had agreed that \"preparing for a no deal will be an operational priority within government but our overall priority is to secure a deal\". He said no-deal planning \"needs to be much more of a priority for businesses\" and there would be a \"significant increase\" in the guidance issued to them over the next 14 weeks, as Brexit day approaches. E-mails will be sent out to 80,000 of those businesses most like to be affected over the next few days. In the autumn of 2017, The Treasury earmarked \u00a33bn for no-deal planning between 2018 and 2020.  In March, Chancellor Philip Hammond said half of that had been allocated to 20 government departments, with the Home Office, transport, the environment and business among the largest recipients.  At Tuesday's cabinet meeting ministers approved the second tranche - plus an under-spend from the current year - to go to departments for the 2019/20 year, with the priority areas being borders, security and international trade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already ordered full \"no deal\" planning across the National Health Service, he told the BBC's Newsnight on Monday. But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, criticised UK ministers, who he said were \"glorifying\" the prospect of leaving without a comprehensive deal in the hope individual agreements could be reached in areas like transport and livestock movements.  Those, like Jeremy Hunt, who glorify a no\u2013deal #Brexit are totally irresponsible. It is not the job of politicians to make the people they lead poorer, remove opportunities, rights & make lives more uncertain. There is no such thing as a \"managed no deal\". https://t.co/f1sPT4R2KS End of Twitter post  by @guyverhofstadt And Labour said a no-deal exit was \"not viable\" and it would work with other parties to stop it. \"It is testament to the prime minister's failure in these negotiations that the government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table,\" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. And the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for another referendum, said the government was \"attempting to scare\" MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal. \"Theresa May is irresponsibly trying to run down the clock so that the only option is to support her discredited deal,\" Sir Vince Cable said.  MPs will vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations, in the middle of January. The deal will only come into force if both the UK and European parliaments approve it. The BBC understands Mrs May is planning to use the Commons vote as a \"moment of reckoning\" for the Brexit process.  Sources have told the BBC that Downing Street will not stand in the way of MPs who seek to amend the government's motion on the Brexit deal to put forward potential alternatives.  The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to push for a further vote of no-confidence in the government as a whole. On Monday night, the Labour leader tabled a motion calling on MPs to declare they have no confidence in the prime minister because she failed to have a vote on her Brexit deal straight away. No 10 has refused to make time for the motion and Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed on Tuesday that there were under no obligation to do so.  Other parties - the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - have called on Mr Corbyn to push for a no-confidence vote against the government as a whole. Unlike a vote aimed at the prime minister, the government would have to allow a vote on this motion and, if successful, it could force a general election. Northern Ireland's DUP, whose votes the Conservative government has relied on in big votes since the June 2017 election, said they would not support Labour.  Mrs May also appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader.  One of them, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would never vote against Mrs May or a Conservative government. He said on Tuesday evening that he had a \"civilised and courteous\" meeting with the PM, and that the government was \"prudent\" to engage in no-deal planning.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46320368", "content": "It feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent.  On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU.  But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed.  She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it.  But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday.  With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons.  Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens.  But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then?  The default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal.  Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019.  That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK.  If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next. Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on \"how it proposes to proceed\".  The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action.  Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen.  Whatever motion the government brings back to Parliament will now have to be amendable, after MPs backed a change to it tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. MPs are hoping this will allow them to vote to rule-out a no-deal Brexit. The government would find it hard to ignore such a vote - but it would not carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March.  Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal.  As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, \"there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute.\"  But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality.  The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play.  The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons.  Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible.  \"The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different\", Sir David said.  Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs.  Theresa May could try to return to Brussels to renegotiate the Northern Irish \"backstop\" - the main sticking point for many MPs. The government has long insisted this is not an option, because the EU has said the existing deal is final and there is no alternative.  Might Brussels give Mrs May some leeway if she loses the vote by a narrowish margin? Some MPs hope she could get behind another version of Brexit at this point. There is support on the Tory benches for a membership of the European Free Trade Area, which would see the UK staying closely linked to the EU, like Norway. This would not be a straightforward move - and would require extensive renegotiation, even if the EU was prepared to contemplate it, and the extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day. Then there is Labour's proposal for a permanent customs union - Mrs May has always ruled that out, but if enough MPs get behind it, it might be an option, although, again, it would need Article 50 to be extended to allow for more talks. Unlikely, given her track record of doggedly ploughing on against the odds - but if she is defeated by a heavy margin on 11 December she may feel she has no other option. There would then be a Tory leadership contest, which would turn into a fight to the death between the Leave and Remain wings of the party, with profound effects on the future of Brexit and, indeed, the country.  Jacob Rees-Mogg's band of Brexiteers famously failed to reach the magic 48 letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest last month. But if she tries to cling on after a significant defeat on 11 December, more MPs could add their names to the list, forcing a no-confidence vote that she might struggle to win. MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit.  At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton.  But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too.  However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by the Political Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000.  The Electoral Commission's recommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day.  This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks. So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree. This is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected.  But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, \"with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem\" of a deadlocked parliament.  That will be the other critical factor at play.  Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait.  There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later. Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government - Labour has said they will table such a motion if Mrs May loses on 11 December.  This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it. This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in. Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit. Another idea that has been floated is a \"negotiated no deal\" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms.  Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote.  Because Parliament will have to come to a view.  As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: \"We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view.  \"I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament.\"  Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process. Instead, she faces a fraught few days and a vote that will define the country's future for many years.  Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons.  But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.  ", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46393399", "content": "Theresa May survived a leadership challenge but that doesn't mean her problems have gone away. The government delayed the crucial vote on the Brexit deal, originally scheduled for 11 November, because they were going to lose. The PM has been back to Brussels and she still hopes to get \"additional reassurance\" from the EU about the backstop. That's the part of the withdrawal agreement that would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland if no trade agreement is reached between the EU and UK by the end of the \"transition period\". The government now says MPs will get the chance to vote on the deal in the week starting 14 January 2019. The Brexit deal cannot be legally implemented until it has been approved in the House of Commons. What would happen if it was rejected? The EU Withdrawal Act, passed by Parliament in June, sets out some rules. The government would have to produce a new plan of action within 21 days and then allow a further vote within another seven sitting days in the House of Commons.  However, the government could act much more quickly than that. And it's possible that political events would transform the situation. Following a government defeat in the Commons on 4 December, MPs would now have more say in proposing alternatives to any plan of action  - but these would still have to be put into law by the government. There's also been a suggestion that MPs could express their views in a series of \"indicative votes\" on a variety of options. Again, though, these would not be binding. The European Court of Justice has ruled that it would be legal for the UK to unilaterally revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit (without the need for agreement from the other 27 EU countries). With the government still committed to Brexit, it's very likely that a major event such as a further referendum or change of government would have to happen before such a move. In the event that MPs eventually do reject the Brexit deal, some of the most likely options are set out below. If nothing else happens, the default position would be a no-deal Brexit. The law is already in place which means the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. And, in any case, EU rules mean the UK would leave then. The government would probably want to pass some legislation to prepare for no-deal but that's not strictly essential.  If MPs aren't happy with the plan they could try to put pressure on the government to change its mind. Their ultimate sanction, if the government wouldn't budge, would be a vote of no confidence - see section four below. If MPs vote against the deal, the government could propose to negotiate a new Brexit deal. This would not be a question of carrying out minor tweaks and having a second vote. That approach now seems less realistic after the government delayed the vote so Theresa May could go to Brussels and seek clarifications.  Instead, there could be a complete renegotiation that would take some time and might well require an extension of Article 50 to delay Brexit. This would require two key steps. First, the UK would have to make a request to the EU for an extension. This could be granted but only if all EU countries agree at a vote of the EU Council. Alternative ways to break Brexit impasse The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Number crunching: Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? A guide to where we are with Brexit Second, the government would have to table a statutory instrument to change the definition of \"exit day\" in the EU Withdrawal Act. MPs would get a chance to vote on this change. If the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, the government would have to plump for one of the other options instead. Theresa May could decide that the best way out of the deadlock would be to hold an early general election - in order to get a political mandate for her deal. She doesn't have the power just to call an election. But, as in 2017, she could ask MPs to vote for an early election under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. Two-thirds of all MPs would need to support the move. The earliest date for the election would be 25 working days later but it could be after that - the prime minister would choose the precise date. As with the \"renegotiate\" plan, this course of action could also involve a request to the EU to extend Article 50. And it's not the only way an election could come about. If the proposed deal is rejected the opposition could call for a formal vote of no confidence. Mrs May could even call for a vote herself to try to reinforce her authority. The rules, under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, mean there are several possible outcomes if the government loses a formal vote of no confidence. If no government is able to win a vote of confidence within 14 days - and that means neither the existing government nor any alternative - then there would be an early general election. The earliest possible date for the election would be 25 working days later. However, if the government wins a confidence motion within this 14-day period, perhaps by offering some new concession, it carries on. The final possibility is a change of government. That could mean another minority Conservative government with a different prime minister, a coalition government, or a minority government of a different party which had the agreement of others to back it in a confidence vote. Clearly, any new government could have a different Brexit policy so the various options could be re-opened. The government could instead choose to have another referendum. As with a renegotiation or early election, this might well require an extension to Article 50. It's probably already too late to hold a referendum before 29 March. And it can't just happen automatically. The rules for referendums are set out in a law called the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. There would have to be a new piece of legislation to make a referendum happen and to determine the rules, such as who would be allowed to vote. It couldn't be rushed through because there has to be time for the Electoral Commission to consider and advise on the referendum question. The question is then defined in the legislation. Once the legislation has been passed the referendum couldn't happen immediately either. There would have to be a statutory \"referendum period\" before the vote takes place. Experts at University College London's Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps above is about 22 weeks. Even if that could be shortened a little, it would still take us well beyond the end of March. As well as the various options for what could happen with Brexit, there could be a lot of other political events going on as well. Now Theresa May has survived a challenge to her leadership the Conservative Party's rules mean she won't face another for 12 months. But she could always decide to resign anyway if she can't get her deal through and she's not prepared to change course. That would trigger a Conservative leadership campaign which would result in the appointment of a new prime minister. She might also come under pressure to resign if MPs pass a \"censure motion\" - that would be a bit like a no confidence vote but without the same automatic consequences. Again this could lead to a change in prime minister or even a change in government. Whoever ended up in charge would still face the same basic range of Brexit options though. ", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46360310", "content": "\"Sounds like a great deal for the EU,\" is a pretty broad statement.  But President Trump was talking in particular about the prospects for future trade agreements.  \"Right now, if you look at the (Brexit) deal,\" he said, \"they (the UK) may not be able to trade with us, and that wouldn't be a good thing.\" Of course, that shouldn't be taken literally - it doesn't mean no trade at all. But as long as the UK remains in a transition period after Brexit, or in a temporary customs union, it will not be able to implement its own free trade deals, cutting or removing tariffs on goods, with the United States or any other third country.   That much is clear, but trade deals aren't just about tariffs. They are also about rules and regulations (known as non-tariff barriers) which are often more important.  And from an \"America-first\" perspective, it's fair to assume that the president thinks Theresa May's Brexit deal makes it more likely that the UK will stay fairly close to the EU in the long term, by following the same (or very similar) regulations in various sectors of the economy. That is a key point. Because the closer the UK stays to the EU's common rules and standards, the more difficult it will be for it to move closer to the rules and standards followed in the United States.   We're talking here not just about examples which come up regularly, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef (broadly speaking, both are allowed in the US and not in the EU), but also about industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  Many big businesses in the UK want to stay close to all those EU rules (its regulatory framework) because the EU is a huge consumer market right on their doorstep. And they tend to follow the EU rules for their global operations because that simply makes things easier.  The numbers are also instructive here. Last year the UK exported \u00a3274bn of goods and services to the rest of the EU and imported \u00a3341bn. The figures for trade with the United States were \u00a3112bn of exports and \u00a370bn of imports.  So, the EU will remain the UK's most important trading partner for some time to come. And if the president was hoping Brexit would mean a more decisive break between the UK and the EU, he may be disappointed. Hence, \"a great deal for the EU\". There is genuine competition in this field between the United States and the European Union.  The EU may not be a military or diplomatic superpower, but it is a regulatory superpower.  That means one of the big choices the UK will have to make in its negotiations on post-Brexit trade agreements is which regulatory and legal orbit it chooses to operate in.  It's not an absolute \"either-or\" decision, but the UK will have to lean one way or the other.  The non-binding political declaration on future UK-EU trade, approved by EU leaders on Sunday, makes this clear.  The EU is insisting on various \"level playing field\" conditions to ensure that the UK cannot gain a competitive advantage by continuing to have privileged access to the EU market without following its rules.  The political declaration says the level playing field should cover \"state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change and relevant tax matters\", and a separate statement issued by the leaders of the EU27 emphasises that they will \"demonstrate particular vigilance\" to ensure that these conditions are followed to the letter.   The declaration also recognises that the UK will develop an independent trade policy in the future. But it stresses that if the goal is to have frictionless trade with the EU, that will depend on how closely aligned the UK remains with the single market and the customs union.  We're back to the unresolved argument about the right balance between economic access and sovereignty.  So where does that leave the UK's future trade relationship with the US? Downing Street points out that there have already been five working-group meetings to discuss the matter.  But this may not be quite the Brexit that Donald Trump had in mind.

Ahead of Mrs May's visit to Scotland, the UK government published analysis which suggested the country's economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under her Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU - but that a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit. The Bank of England subsequently warned that a no-deal Brexit would send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis. Mrs May's proposals are opposed by Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionists and many Conservative MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate - meaning she currently looks unlikely to get parliamentary approval for her deal. On Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon unveiled a Scottish government analysis paper which claimed the Brexit deal could cost Scotland \u00a39bn a year by 2030, compared to if it had remained in the EU. Ms Sturgeon, who wants the UK to remain permanently in the single market and customs union and has backed calls for another referendum on the Brexit terms, has said the SNP's 35 MPs at Westminster will vote against the deal on 11 December. But the prime minister said the deal she had negotiated for the UK would be a \"good deal for Scotland\" as it would provide a \"free trade area with no tariffs, no fees\". She added: \"That will mean a opportunity to carry on their trade. but also gives us the opportunity to negotiate trade deals around the world that will be good for great Scottish exports like Scotch Whisky, Scottish salmon and smoked salmon.  \"So this is a deal that is right for Scotland and right for Scottish fishermen, because we'll take back control of our waters and ensure they have a bright future for Scottish fishing.\" Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has suggested it is \"inevitable\" another EU referendum will be called if Labour are not able to force a general election. But Mrs May said his comments were proof that Labour \"want to go against and overturn the vote of the British people\". The UK government has highlighted the support the deal has received in recent days from Diageo, National Farming Union Scotland, the Scotch Whisky Association and BAE Systems, who have also warned about the consequences of \"no deal\" for Scotland. Jim Ratcliffe - the owner of chemicals giant Ineos, which operates the Grangemouth facility - has also said Mrs May's deal had his \"full support\", describing it as a \"pragmatic and sensible arrangement\". The company said its analysis showed a no-deal Brexit would carry \"significant risk\" for its business, and urged MPs to \"put the good of the country ahead of political considerations and ensure a safe passage for the deal through Parliament.\" The trip to Scotland was the latest stop in a two-week tour by Mrs May as she tries to promote and sell her deal to the public and business. On Tuesday, the prime minister made similar visits to Wales and Northern Ireland - where she faced criticism from Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact to support the Conservative government in key votes. And speaking as she unveiled the Scottish government's latest Brexit analysis paper, Ms Sturgeon said the deal was \"unacceptable to the Scottish government and damaging to the people of Scotland\".  The document included analysis - first published in January - claiming that a new free trade agreement could leave Scots \u00a31,600 worse off per year by 2030, compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU. It also warned the \"backstop\" being put in place to prevent the return to a hard border in Ireland could leave Scotland at a \"serious competitive disadvantage\" to Northern Ireland. Ms Sturgeon said: \"It will not end uncertainty. It will extend it. We are being asked to accept a blindfold Brexit with all the difficult decisions kicked down the road.\"", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46375841", "content": "Former Brexit Secretary David Davis has attacked government estimates that show leaving the EU will make the UK worse off - calling it \"project fear 2.0\" The Tory backbencher said forecasts by the Treasury are often proved \"wrong\" and are based on \"flawed assumptions\". He again called for MPs to reject Theresa May's \"bogus\" Brexit deal.  The Treasury says the economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years Mrs May's plan, compared with staying in the EU. But they claim a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the deal was not just about the economy, but would deliver \"political benefits\". Speaking at an event held by the Economists for Free Trade in London, Mr Davis, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit plans, said the government figures were part of a \"propaganda onslaught\" ahead of a vote on the deal on 11 December.  He said: \"Treasury forecasts in the past have almost never been right and have more often been dramatically wrong.\" Mr Davis said predictions that the economy in the UK would contract by 2.1% in the 18 months after the referendum were unfounded - in fact it grew by 2.8% - along with other concerns around unemployment and incomes. \"None of this spine-chilling nonsense came to pass,\" he said. The prominent Brexiteer also used his speech to continue his criticism of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for leaving the EU and the political declaration for the future relationship.  He said that it would leave the UK subject to EU single market rules and \"annexes\" Northern Ireland. Any MP voting in support of the PM's deal would \"repudiate\" the wishes of the public and cause \"incalculable\" damage to the country's democracy, Mr Davis added.  And he claimed it would also deprive the UK of the \"chief economic benefits\" of Brexit by stopping it from negotiating free trade deals around the world. But Mr Davis had no fear around leaving with a no deal and reverting to World Trade Organisation rules, saying it would \"involve all the choking tentacles of the EU falling away\". \"The future of the UK economy does not lie with the EU but with the wider world,\" he said. The government earlier published a 83-page document on the long-term economic impact of Brexit on the UK.  It compares the likely impact of Mrs May's deal with the alternative scenarios of Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area, a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU and a no-deal Brexit. It says that GDP will be lower in 15 years under all Brexit scenarios than it would be with EU membership. And in all cases, national income will be reduced if migration from Europe is reduced from its current levels. But Chancellor Philip Hammond said that staying in the EU was not politically \"viable\".", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46192884", "content": "Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now?  The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum.  The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, although two ministers resigned in protest at it. They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest.  If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament.  There are two documents. A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: The other document is a 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as \"a set of instructions to negotiators\" working on a legally-binding treaty.  Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.  The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that \"widespread and deep concern\" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected \"by a significant margin\". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to \"ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely\" and has \"democratic legitimacy\". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its \"money, laws and borders\" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer.  She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be \"no Brexit at all\". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU.  Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46373786", "content": "Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. Will the UK be worse off under the prime minister's Brexit plans or not? That was the question Jeremy Corbyn wanted answering at this session, after the Treasury published an analysis suggesting the UK would be less well off under all Brexit options when compared with staying in the EU. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had said Mrs May's deal would mitigate \"most\" of the negative impacts of Brexit, said the Labour leader. Which of the negative impacts would not be mitigated? Mrs May said her deal was the best available to protect the economy and \"honour\" the EU referendum result. The \"biggest risk\" to the economy was a Labour government, she added. \"It is not hard to be the best deal if it is the only deal,\" observed the Labour leader, \"by definition it is also the worst\". In fact, he went on, there was no deal \"just a 26-page wish list\".

My weekend shopping list is longer than that\"Follow #PMQs live: https://t.co/tYluBACMOK pic.twitter.com/K2ElC4POZf End of Twitter post  by @BBCPolitics Referring to Philip Hammond saying the UK would be \"slightly worse off\" under the prime minister's deal, Mr Corbyn noted the chancellor's absence from the front bench and asked if Mrs May agreed with his remarks. Mrs May said: \"The analysis shows the deal we have negotiated is the best deal for the economy and delivers on the results of the referendum. \"He calls the political declaration a wish list, but this is an ambitious, broad and flexible partnership,\" she added. \"The Labour Party has six bullet points to offer. My weekend shopping list is longer than that.\" The Labour leader quoted a damning UN report, which had said it was \"clear\" the impact of Brexit on people in poverty was an \"after-thought\". If the PM's deal was so great, he asked, why were MPs \"not queuing up\" to back it? Farmers in Wales, fishermen in Scotland and employers in Northern Ireland were backing it, claimed the prime minister. She defended the government's economic record, saying figures today showed the number of children living in workless households was \"at a record low\". Mr Corbyn quoted the UN report again, which said there were 14 million people living in poverty in the UK. He then quoted business leaders, who had said her Brexit deal was the \"worst of all worlds\". She had gone from \"guaranteeing frictionless trade, to offering friction and less trade\", said the Labour leader, and the country had \"no faith\" in the next stage of talks being completed within two years. Did the PM prefer \"extending the transition with further vast payments to the European Union or falling into the backstop with no exit\", asked Mr Corbyn. There is an exit \"from the backstop\", said Mrs May, and it was \"perfectly possible\" to turn the 26-page political declaration into legal text within two years. Then it was on to the attorney general's legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, which Labour wants published in full.  Mrs May had petitioned Tony Blair for the full legal advice on the Iraq war to be published, said Mr Corbyn, what has changed? Mrs May cited client confidentiality and said MPs would get to see a \"full reasoned position statement\" and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement and answer MPs questions. Mr Corbyn said the government was the most shambolic \"in living memory\" and 20 of her own ministers had resigned.  It was \"clear that Parliament will not back this plan\", he told the PM and it was time for her to \"accept that reality, make way for an alternative plan that can work for the whole country\". Mrs May said she \"will take no lectures\" from someone who has had more than \"100 resignations\" from his frontbench. She said \"what really lies behind Labour's approach\" was a desire to \"cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people... that would be a betrayal of the many by the few\". The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford also made hay with Philip Hammond's comments on the economic impact of Theresa May's Brexit plans.

Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith asked if the prime minister had \"personally intervened\" to stop the UK offering sanctuary to a Pakistani Christian. Theresa May told SNP\u2019s Douglas Chapman the government has been working with devolved administrations to ensure \"the voice of the devolved administrations has been heard\". Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session: After the PM endured another 45 minutes at the dispatch box, dodging the Brexit crossfire from the opposition and her own party's various factions, what have we learned? Theresa May stuck by her line that the government would not release the full text of its legal advice on the Brexit deal - no surprise, really, and it would have been a bit of a surrender and a dangerous precedent, had she agreed. Instead she said the government's top lawyer, the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, could make a statement to MPs, and answer questions. Did the answer to Labour's Dame Louise Ellman signal some subtle softening on the issue of a second referendum? The PM has rebuffed endless requests for a so-called \"People's Vote\" over the last few weeks, usually observing that there has already been a referendum, and often adding that the main parties at the last election promised to respect the result. This time the prime minister did say that it was important to deliver on the decision of the people, but also added that there would not be time to hold a further referendum before Brexit Day - 29 March - as the Article 50 period (the period before the UK left, having given notice of intent to withdraw) would have to be extended. Random variation of phrase, or a soft signal of some kind? Hmmm. Jeremy Corbyn enjoyed himself in a target-rich environment, noting that Theresa May once demanded that Tony Blair published his advice on the legality of the Iraq War, and highlighting the opposition to her Brexit deal among her own MPs. But the real threat to the PM was behind her, on the Conservative benches. Brexiteers Anne Marie Trevelyan, Peter Bone and David Amess all attacked aspects of the deal, and received polite rebuffs. And the Scottish Conservative Douglas Ross raised the dangers of a fisheries deal which did not meet promises to the fishing industry. The PM sailed through it all\u2026 this was much of a muchness with the questioning in the series of Brexit statements over the last fortnight. And perhaps the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu drained some of the hostility from this latest repeat performance. Hard Brexiteers to the right of her, Remainers to the left, Labour with its cannons trained on her, and leadership rivals lurking under camouflage, the PM seems to be heading for certain defeat in the Meaningful Vote in a fortnight. Yet on she goes. Westminster is, frankly, a bit baffled. Does she have some masterstroke to deploy? Has she banked the prospect of defeat and based her strategy on a second vote to get through a slightly tweaked deal - with modest concessions from Brussels already prepared and waiting? Or is she simply hoping against hope that her opponents, internal or external, will somehow retreat at the last moment. Is it magnificent? Is it politics? We'll know in a fortnight. Remember, Theresa May will be at the dispatch box for PMQs the day after the Meaningful Vote. Maybe all will be revealed two weeks today.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46344443", "content": "The prime minister has reported back to the House of Commons on the outcome of the EU's Brexit summit in Brussels and urged MPs to vote in favour of the \"best and only\" available deal.  Many of her arguments echoed those in a \"letter to the nation\" released by Downing Street over the weekend.  BBC Reality Check has pulled out some of the key lines in the letter. Theresa May: \"We will take back control of our borders, by putting an end to the free movement of people once and for all.\" Reality Check analysis: Yes, in the long term, free movement of people will come to an end - but it will continue during the transition (or implementation) period after Brexit, which is currently due to end on 31 December 2020 but could be extended by \"one or two years\".  After that, when the UK leaves the EU single market, the requirement to allow the free movement of people from the EU will no longer apply and the UK will be free to set its own immigration policy.  It also means, of course, that free movement in the other direction, for UK citizens travelling to the EU, will come to an end, although both sides have pledged to avoid the imposition of visas for short-term visits, such as holidays.   Theresa May: \"We will take back control of our money, by putting an end to vast annual payments to the EU. \"Instead, we will be able to spend British taxpayers' money on our own priorities, like the extra \u00a3394m per week that we are investing in our long-term plan for the NHS.\" Reality Check analysis: Annual payments into the EU budget will continue to be calculated in the same way during the transition period, until 31 December 2020. After that, if transition is extended, substantial payments to the EU budget will still have to be made but they will be calculated separately.  There will also be additional payments as part of the financial settlement (or divorce bill) that the UK has agreed with the EU in its withdrawal agreement - but after a few years, they will be reduced fairly rapidly. The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast, for example, that the divorce bill payment in 2022-23 will be \u00a37.9bn, which is \u00a35.6bn less than it forecasts the UK would pay if it remained in the EU.  Some budget payments will still have to be made to cover the EU programmes the UK would like to remain part of. And none of this takes account of the potential impact on the economy of leaving the EU. The vast majority of economists expect the UK economy to be smaller in the first few years after Brexit than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU.  Government analysis, comparing the economic impact of the prime minister's deal, no deal and staying in the EU, is expected to be released in the coming days. As for \u00a3394m a week to spend on the NHS, that money has come from a government decision to devote more tax receipts to health spending. It should not be confused with a similar number, \u00a3350m a week, that was written on the side of the Vote Leave bus.  Theresa May: \"We will take back control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. \"In future, our laws will be made, interpreted and enforced by our own courts and legislatures.\" Reality Check analysis: Yes, the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will eventually come to an end in the UK.  It will continue to apply in full during the transition period. And then for eight years after that, the ECJ will have a role with regards to the rights of EU citizens in the UK.  If there is any dispute about what the withdrawal agreement says about citizens' rights during that period, the ECJ will decide on matters of EU law. But in practice, that is likely to involve no more than a handful of cases.  In terms of a dispute resolution mechanism between the UK and the EU in the future, a joint committee of officials from both sides will be set up - and if they can't agree, it can go to independent arbitration.  On any matters of EU law though, and there will be a lot of EU law entwined in the future relationship, the ECJ will have a final binding say.  Theresa May: \"We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy that has failed our farmers and out of the Common Fisheries Policy that has failed our coastal communities. Reality Check analysis: Countries with a very close relationship with the EU, such as Norway, can choose to be outside the CAP and the CFP - and the UK will be no different, once the post-Brexit transition period is over.  But we saw during the EU's Brexit summit in Brussels that independence can have consequences. The French President, Emmanuel Macron, was one of several EU leaders who warned that future negotiations on fishing would be extremely tough.  The UK sells nearly \u00a31bn of fish produce to the EU every year - and a number of EU countries are insisting that tariff-free trade of that kind can continue only if EU fishing boats continue to get access to UK waters.  Theresa May: \"EU citizens who have built their lives in the United Kingdom will have their rights protected, as will UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU.\" Reality Check analysis:  Under the withdrawal agreement, EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK, of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after transition. And anyone staying in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.  But many UK citizens living on the continent (and there are at least one million of them) feel that their rights aren't being protected. Particularly those whose jobs rely on selling services - as architects, or chefs, or lorry drivers, or lawyers - across borders. They don't work in one country alone. But the withdrawal treaty does not guarantee that they will be able to continue working in the same way after Brexit - what are known as 'mobility issues' will only be negotiated as part of the future relationship.    Theresa May: \"Because our European friends will always be our allies in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the deal will ensure that security co-operation will continue, so we can keep our people safe.\" Reality Check analysis: Both sides obviously want extremely close security co-operation to continue but there are still some legal and technical hurdles to overcome. There are some security databases, the EU insists, that can be accessed in real-time by only EU member states.  The political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship says access to several databases will \"approximate\" the capabilities shared with full member states, rather than replicate them.  The declaration also suggests the EU will offer the UK \"operational co-operation\" rather than full membership of the EU police agency Europol and the judicial co-operation agency Eurojust.  Theresa May: \"Crucially, it will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - so people can live their lives as they do now.\" Reality Check analysis: The withdrawal agreement does ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but only because it includes the option of using the backstop plan that has proved so unpopular among many Tory Brexiteers and the DUP.  It is worth emphasising that neither side actually wants the backstop to come into effect - it raises a series of awkward questions for the EU too.  But the fact that the backstop includes the provision for a temporary customs union for the whole of the UK, an arrangement that the UK cannot leave unilaterally, will continue to be controversial.  Theresa May: \"Outside the EU, we will be able to sign new trade deals with other countries and open up new markets in the fastest-growing economies around the world.\" Reality Check analysis: As long as the UK is in a transition period, or if the backstop has to come into effect, the UK will not be able to implement its own trade deals on goods (deals that remove or cut tariffs) with other countries.  The withdrawal agreement and the political declaration commit both sides to use their \"best endeavours\" to agree a comprehensive future free trade deal that will solve the Irish border problem.  But the EU continues to insist the only way to keep the border as open as it is now is to have completely frictionless trade and it argues that that can be done only by staying in the customs union and the single market.  The government disagrees but this basic argument has been postponed not resolved.

The \"space country\" record, which was written as the star fell in love with her husband, has topped a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News. Janelle Monae's radical, inclusive Dirty Computer came second, while indie star Mitski's Be The Cowboy was third. The top seven were all by female artists, with Cardi B and Ariana Grande rounding out the top five. The full top 20 looked like this: The results were compiled using 35 \"album of the year\" lists published by the most influential magazines, newspapers and blogs in music - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Popsugar and The Times. Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on. Altogether, critics raved about 194 albums, from Kendrick Lamar's blockbuster Black Panther soundtrack to Kamasi Washington's colourful and daring jazz album Heaven & Earth. Variety magazine even picked an unreleased album for its list. Up, by the British alt-rock band Ultimate Painting, was pulled from release in February when the band split up \"due to an irreconcilable breakdown\". But Texan singer Musgraves emerged as the clear winner with her third album, Golden Hour. A swoonsome collection of low-key love songs, it expands the 30-year-old's country sound with dreamy synth textures and unexpected flashes of disco. It was inspired, she said, by artists ranging from Dolly Parton to Daft Punk via Sade and the Bee Gees. End of Youtube post  by KaceyMusgravesVEVO \"I thought there's got to be a world where all these things can live together harmoniously - a place where futurism meets traditionalism,\" Musgraves told Rolling Stone.  \"I still love steel guitar and banjo, but I thought it would be dope if we put that with a vocoder and explored that world. \"The goal for this record was to sound great when you're sitting there at 2AM, thinking about everything.\"  Entertainment Weekly called it \"her most accomplished and least traditional body of work to date\", while The Guardian's Alexis Petridis said: \"You'll be hard pushed to find a better collection of pop songs this year.\" The album, which is up for four awards at next year's Grammys, fared particularly well with US critics, topping \"best of 2018\" lists on Entertainment Weekly, People Magazine and US Weekly, among others. Amongst UK critics, the politicised pop of Christine and the Queens' Chris was the year's most popular album, with punk band Idles taking second place.  But reviewers largely ignored 2018's biggest-selling albums, with only a handful of nominations for Drake's Scorpion, George Ezra's Staying At Tamara's and Post Malone's Beerbongs & Bentleys. Read more about the albums that made the top 10 below: \"We want to punch new holes in the possibilities of music,\" Minnesota band Low told The Guardian earlier this year.   And that's exactly what they do on their 12th album, Double Negative, a glacial, hypnotic record that frequently threatens to disintegrate and collapse on itself. Melodies appear out of static; instruments are stretched and mutilated; distortion threatens to consume entire songs. But then there'll be a sudden moment of quiet clarity, as husband-and-wife Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker's delicate harmonies take centre stage. For a band who were associated with minimalist \"slowcore\" music, it's as dramatic a reinvention as the one Radiohead took on Kid A; with all of that record's oppressive menace. Sparhawk said the music was a visceral, physical response to the first year of Donald Trump's presidency. \"The songs are more desperate, more kind of reaching,\" he said in that same Guardian interview. \"My reaction to a more chaotic world is to fight back with something more chaotic.\"  End of Youtube post  by Sub Pop Five years after the thrilling, radio-friendly riffs of AM, Arctic Monkeys take a detour into eerie, weightless space rock.

Drawing on film noir soundtracks and the tacky glamour of 70s lounge music, the album is alienating at first - but, over time, Turner's meandering stream-of-consciousness gains a peculiar, zonked-out charm. It split opinion amongst fans but, in the long run, it guaranteed the band's continued existence. \"At the risk of tripping myself up and plunging into pretentiousness, I don't know how I could've done anything that would've been more... 'instantly gratifying' than this,\" Turner told Q Magazine.  \"I really can't imagine what else I could have done.\" End of Youtube post  by ArcticMonkeysVEVO Kanye West produced five albums in the space of five weeks this summer, but his collaboration with Pusha T was by far the best. Over seven tight, filler-free songs, he barely pauses for breath, whether he's recapping his credentials (If You Know You Know) or staging a vicious takedown of Drake (Infrared). Kanye peppers the album with old blues riffs and soul samples but, under that veneer, the record can be unrelentingly bleak. The cover - a photo of Whitney Houston's drug-filled bathroom - is as tasteless as Pusha's repeated attempts to glorify his former career as a cocaine dealer. But his command of the mic is compelling, even when the subject matter is knotty. \"Listening to Pusha T rap is like watching a skyscraper get built one steel girder at a time,\" said New York Times critic Jon Caramanica.  \"Every step is carefully programmed, every angle is crisp, and the sum total effect is overpowering.\" End of Youtube post  by PushaTVEVO \"There's a pride in my singing / The thickness of a new skin / I am done with belonging,\" sings Heloise Letissier on Comme Si, the opening track of her second album. It's an outsider's reaction to success - in this case, the worldwide embrace of Letissier's debut. Chaleur Humaine, and its themes of gender and queer identity. She doubles down on that message here, subverting female stereotypes, accentuating her masculinity and arguing for women's sexual agency. \"The second album is made with a bit more defiance, because I wanted to be sure people really knew who they met the first time,\" she told The Independent. But she never lets the message get in the way of a killer hook, and fills her (self-produced) album with supple, danceable grooves worthy of Michael Jackson himself. End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Ariana Grande's world turned upside down on 22 May 2017, when a bomber killed 22 of her fans outside a concert in Manchester.  Her fourth album candidly describes the fallout - from Breathin's vivid depiction of a panic attack, to the steely resolve she displays on No Tears Left To Cry and The Light Is Coming (\"to give back everything the darkness stole\"). Pushing against pop convention, half of the tracks are produced by Pharrell Williams, whose skeletal, off-kilter productions that create a wide open space for Grande's soaring vocals. The rest of the album, overseen by Swedish pop maestro Max Martin, is more formulaic; revelling in Grande's romance with comedian Pete Davidson.  Then, three months after Sweetener was released, she issued the post-script, Thank U, Next, which detailed their break-up. End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Robyn emerged from her eight-year hibernation the same, but different. The Swedish star is still making music you can dance and cry to at the same time - but she's traded the armour-plated pop bangers of her previous albums for a series of slow-burning, deconstructed club jams. The tracks are ordered chronologically; tracing the ebb and flow of Robyn's emotions as she dealt with the death of her friend and mentor Christian Falk, and a turbulent period in her relationship with director Max Vitali. Songs are filled with white noise and disorienting rhythms as she reaches out in the dark, trying to reconnect with the world.  That she gets there via the dancefloor is no surprise, and she distils those experiences into a luminous record that's as sticky as the title suggests.  End of Youtube post  by RobynVEVO A former dancer and social media personality, Cardi B arrived at rapping relatively late in the day - but she grasped the opportunity with both hands. \"I used to be a stripper,\" she told James Corden on her recent episode of Carpool Karaoke, \"so when I got really popular on Instagram and I was stripping throughout the United States, I was going around listening to what people were listening to.  \"A lot of people have different styles, so I was like, 'What would be something that people from every coast would love and enjoy?' and it's like 'Boom!'\" But her debut album does more than cherry-pick current rap trends, it's laden with pop hooks (I Like It) and piercingly funny lyrics (Get Up 10), allowing the Bronx-born star to overtake all of her contemporaries. End of Youtube post  by Cardi B Mitski Miyawaki's fifth album is a collection of strange and beguiling vignettes about loneliness and love on the wane. \"I know no-one will save me, I just need someone to kiss,\" she sings on the deceptively upbeat single Nobody. \"Give me one good honest kiss / And I'll be alright.\" The songs are written from the point of view of a \"woman who feels powerless and overcompensates by exercising extreme control on herself and on her environment,\" Mitski told The Outline. \"But [she's] unravelling a little bit because the amount of control she's exercising on to herself maybe isn't healthy or isn't natural.\" Reflecting the protagonist's fracturing psyche, the album crams 14 tracks into just 33 minutes, with Mitski's serrated guitar riffs and mordant lyrics the sole connective tissue. \"Be the Cowboy shows that love and loss can be grand and small at the same time,\" said Sputnik Music. \"That two minutes is more than enough time to melt down emotion into a pure concentrate and nearly drown yourself in it.\" End of Youtube post  by MitskiVEVO \"I am not America's nightmare, I am the American dream,\" sings Janelle Monae on Dirty Computer, an album that is proudly female, black and queer. She sings about sexual bliss on Make Me Feel and Pynk; rages against male oppression on Django Jane; and prays for her country's soul on Americans. \"I wanted to be as bold as possible in making statements around agency, around women's bodies and rights,\" she said. \"[It's about] us taking back the mic and letting you know that you don't own us and we won't be controlled.\" Dirty Computer's euphoric mix of sex and politics feels like a fresh introduction to the star, who'd previously hidden behind the persona of an R&B cyborg - but one thing hasn't changed: Her ability to make you dance.  End of Youtube post  by Janelle Mon\u00e1e On her fourth album, Musgraves escapes the orbit of country music, yet stays true to its roots, with a collection of blissed-up, spaced-out pop songs. The record was written as she fell for her now-husband, Ruston Kelly, who she says opened her mind \"to a kind of love I never really envisioned for myself\". \"I was like, 'Man, I wonder if I'm gonna be able to write. I've never felt like this before,'\" she told The Independent. \"And it actually ended up being kind of the opposite for me. It changed my world, it made me see the world in a more beautiful way.\" \"That kind of inspiration can't be faked,\" said the Boston Globe in its review. \"And Golden Hour has so many similarly enchanting moments it practically glows.\" In lesser hands, Golden Hour's contentedness could be suffocating, but Musgraves has enough lyrical bite to keep things fresh, as well as a pleasingly carefree approach to genre - not least on the disco-country crossover High Horse. \"I was on a giant Bee Gees kick going into this record, I could not quit,\" she told Stereogum. \"And also I love Sade. I was kinda thinking, 'Man, what would it sound like if Sade made a country album?'\" Well, now we know.

Speaking to the BBC following an exclusive playback of a handful of new tracks, Ronson - who recently produced albums for Lady Gaga and Queens of the Stone Age - says the songs have come together with the help of kindred spirits. \"That's kind of what made the collaborators on this record - more so than choosing a person for a musical style - they were all like-minded people, or people who were going through some traumatic personal stuff,\" says Ronson. The 43-year-old producer and DJ has just gone though a divorce from French model and actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume and says it's given him a different approach to his own music, putting lyrics and emotion ahead of the beats. \"I've obviously worked with people and got to work on records where people have an incredible emotional output that goes on their music, like [Amy Winehouse's] Back To Black,\" he says. \"It doesn't always have to be depressing, I tried doing some other music, whatever I could do not to relive Uptown Funk but the only stuff that started to stick was the stuff that moved me and made me feel melancholy.  \"Once I had two or three of those, I started to see all this as an album.\" 11/29 \ud83d\udc94 @MarkRonson pic.twitter.com/fvX2xvCYrj End of Twitter post  by @MileyCyrus Ronson introduced the new tracks, which feature vocal performances from Miley Cyrus, Swedish pop star Lykke Li and newcomer Arkansas singer-songwriter Yebba, as a series of \"sad bangers\" - heavy on emotion but equally serious about filling dance floors. Afterwards, he clarifies: \"Obviously, I didn't invent 'sad bangers', far from it, Don't Leave Me This Way, I Will Survive, the entire outputs of Robyn and Drake and all the emo stuff but it was nice, even if I had to go through some stuff to have a bit of a concept present itself because then otherwise my records don't have a reason to exist. \"I'm not saying that the bad stuff was worth it but [the music] was definitely a positive by-product of that.\" The lead taster track is the futuristic country-tinged Nothing Breaks Like A Heart featuring Cyrus - whose most recent album Younger Now saw her reclaim her folksy Tennessee roots which preceded her current status as a pop superstar.  \"It wasn't an intentional thing,\" says Ronson of the chugging country disco beat and acoustic guitar riff. \"I heard the drawl in her voice and the twang when I saw her live on SNL (Saturday Night Live). My jaw dropped and I became super-fixated about being able to work with her.  \"But we weren't trying to make a Western song. I think with Miley, just the way she wrote the verses and the way the melody came out, came naturally.\" Other voices on the as-yet-untitled record will include newcomer King Princess - a New York-based artist who is being hotly-tipped for a big 2019.  She is also the first signing to Ronson's own Zelig label. \"I'm just a massive fan and love watching her develop with leaps and bounds with everything she puts out,\" he says. \"She just came to Shangri-La (producer Rick Rubin's Malibu studio) where we were hanging out for a week. \"We tried to get it right three or four times and I said, 'This is a great song but give me something from here [Ronson points to his chest], something that hurts and she wrote this song and came back and I was like, 'This is wonderful'.\" A quick visit to Ronson's Wikipedia page shows the impressive list of artists he has worked with since his debut in 1997, but has anybody ever said no to a collaboration? \"Yes, everyone says no at first and then I kind of like wear them down,\" he laughs. In front of an audience of largely music industry people, Ronson joked the new music has arrived as he \"owes the label an album\" but he also claimed young fans are caring less and less about the format. Stats provided by trade body the BPI earlier this year said streaming now accounts for more than half (50.4%) of all music consumption in the UK with a record 1.5 billion streams served in one week last December. In the UK, album sales actually saw a rise, in total, 135.1 million albums were sold, an increase of 9.5%. However, in the US - the world's biggest music market - sales have plummeted. Figures published by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), showed sales dropped by more than 25% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 2017. Joshua Friedlander, the senior vice-president for Strategic Data Analysis for the RIAA told the BBC: \"The changes we're seeing in the market are a reflection of the way fans are listening to music, but ultimately it's up to each artist and his or her label partner to decide how best to release their music - as a body of work in an album or EP, a singles strategy, or a combination of both.  He added: \"While revenues from traditional album formats such as CDs and digital albums have declined in recent years, they are now being more than offset by an increase in revenues from streaming.\"  \"People are going to stream and listen to whatever they want,\" said Ronson. \"But when there's something that really sits together, like a concept - like the new Metro Boomin album - because he's about the people that he's come up with, like 21 Savage and Travis Scott -  that record's come straight in at number one because you know that album sits together. \"People like Solange and Daft Punk can put a record out and you really believe it was made that way. I guess for me it doesn't matter so much whether it's a dying art form because it is the only art form that I know.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Now in its 17th year, the list showcases 2019's hottest new artists. Past winners includes Adele, Sam Smith, Years & Years and Sigrid. This year's selection focuses on solo acts, with only one band in the top 10. It was voted for by 136 critics, broadcasters and DJs, including former nominees Ellie Goulding and Stormzy. For the first time, the list includes an artist who performs in Spanish. Catalan singer Rosal\u00eda has struck gold by fusing flamenco rhythms with the aesthetics of trap and hip-hop, and recently won two Latin Grammys for her breakout hit Malamente. Signed to Sony, she is being promoted as a mainstream act in the UK, rather than being relegated to the ghetto of \"world music\" - a sure sign of Latin pop's increasing significance. Also among the nominees is France-born, London-based rapper Octavian, whose minimal, spacious mixtapes have marked him out as one of the UK's most intriguing talents. His breakout song Party Here even earned a co-sign from Drake - although the 22-year-old was quick to assert his independence. \"It proves that it's all possible, but I don't want anything more from him,\" he told Pitchfork earlier this year. The resurgence in soul is reflected by Mahalia and Ella Mai. The latter is already a breakout star in the US, where her sumptuous single Boo'd Up topped the R&B charts over the summer. It also and earned her two Grammy nominations on Friday, including one in the prestigious song of the year category. The list also includes Irish singer-songwriter Dermot Kennedy, whose expressive voice and heart-wrenching ballads have earned comparisons to Damien Rice and Rag N' Bone Man; and the absurdly catchy indie band Sea Girls.  US singer King Princess has been branded \"an icon for the next generation of queer youth\" for her refreshingly honest, lyrically-led pop songs, while soulful singer-songwriter Grace Carter has just finished her first UK headline tour. Two UK rappers complete the 10-strong list - Flohio from south London and Slowthai from Northampton. BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac said the list was \"filled with incredibly talented people and is a real reflection of where music is heading in 2019\". She added: \"So many of the artists are truly innovating in their fields. It's exciting to champion new music across the BBC and share these artists with the audience.\" Last year's winner Sigrid said topping the list \"helped me so much with reaching a new audience and giving my music some extra exposure on the radio\". This year's top five will be revealed in January on Radio 1 and BBC News, with one artist announced each day from Monday, 7 January. The winner will be revealed on Friday 11 January.

It's hardly surprising: The record was the UK's best-seller last year, shifting more than 2.5 million copies. Hit records by George Ezra, Adele and Dua Lipa also feature in the Top 50, which was released to coincide with National Album Day. But a closer look at Alexa's most-popular albums reveals behaviour that may concern the music industry. When people use voice commands to stream music, they consistently ask for songs they already know, with new artists largely frozen out of the picture. For instance, Ed Sheeran accounts for three of the top five most-requested records; while there are multiple entries in the Top 50 for stars like Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, Little Mix, and Katy Perry. Just eight of Alexa's top 50 albums were released this year, and only two of those were debuts - Cardi B's Invasion of Privacy and Anne-Marie's Speak Your Mind. By contrast, the Official Charts Company says 16 of this year's best-selling albums are new releases, with three debuts in the Top 40. The Alexa chart highlights a known problem with voice-activated listening - that there's a significant barrier to discovering new music. \"If you're looking at Spotify on your phone or your computer a lot of stuff is presented to you, so you might go, 'Oh, so-and-so's got a new album out, I'll give that a go'\" says Mark Sutherland, editor of Music Week. \"But if all the decision-making is put upon you, and you have to tell Alexa what to choose, then inevitably you're likely to go for tried-and-trusted, more familiar music.\" Amazon Music's head of programming, Alex Luke, acknowledged the problem at last week's Music Week Tech Summit in London. \"It's one of the things we've realised as we've been forging this path into voice - discovery is a challenge for unknown artists,\" he said.  Notably, albums like Michael Jackson's Thriller, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell are well-represented in Alexa's most-requested list; upending the convention that streaming services favour current hits over the classics.  Compilation albums were excluded from the chart, Amazon said, otherwise The Greatest Showman soundtrack would have topped the list. One of the main challenges for voice-activated discovery of new music on smart speakers is the user's lack of knowledge about what to ask for. And let's face it: Even if people do ask for the right thing, many speakers sadly still struggle to get that right and default to Ed, Adele or Taylor Swift - which only skews personalisation algorithms further into thinking that's what you actually want to hear. But it is actually personalisation that is the key to surfacing new music on smart speakers. Much like traditional radio they need to sandwich in new tracks between the classics, based on what they know you like.  The more these voice assistants know about you the more they can properly cater for your needs and preferences. We're a little way off yet, but I've no doubt they'll all crack that soon.  The issue of music discovery is a big concern for record labels and musicians alike; especially as voice-activated speakers are one of the UK's fastest-growing consumer products. About 5 million UK adults now have a smart speaker at home, according to Ipsos Mori; while research from the US says that 90% of owners use the devices listen to music at least once a week, and they are poised to overtake mobile phones as the most common way of accessing their favourite songs. Amazon is the market leader, with its Alexa-enabled devices accounting for about 65% of all smart speakers sold in the UK. However, says Sutherland, \"the most commonly-asked question to Alexa is 'play music'\".  \"So until Alexa evolves to the stage where she suggests things to you, instead of you suggesting things to her, it's going to be hard to get people to say, 'Alexa, play me this person. I'm not sure who they are or what the record is called because it's brand new'.  \"That's an unlikely scenario in your kitchen.\" Amazon hopes to encourage listeners to try new music through its \"Weekly One\" feature - which promotes a new song by an emerging artist every week.  There's also a UK Rising playlist that showcases new music; and a feature that allows users to request \"the most popular songs in Manchester\" and other UK cities. For now, though, Ed Sheeran reigns supreme. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU.  But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed.  She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it.  But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday.  With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons.  Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens.  But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then?  The default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal.  Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019.  That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK.  If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next. Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on \"how it proposes to proceed\".  The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action.  Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen.  Whatever motion the government brings back to Parliament will now have to be amendable, after MPs backed a change to it tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. MPs are hoping this will allow them to vote to rule-out a no-deal Brexit. The government would find it hard to ignore such a vote - but it would not carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March.  Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal.  As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, \"there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute.\"  But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality.  The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play.  The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons.  Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible.  \"The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different\", Sir David said.  Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs.  Theresa May could try to return to Brussels to renegotiate the Northern Irish \"backstop\" - the main sticking point for many MPs. The government has long insisted this is not an option, because the EU has said the existing deal is final and there is no alternative.  Might Brussels give Mrs May some leeway if she loses the vote by a narrowish margin? Some MPs hope she could get behind another version of Brexit at this point. There is support on the Tory benches for a membership of the European Free Trade Area, which would see the UK staying closely linked to the EU, like Norway. This would not be a straightforward move - and would require extensive renegotiation, even if the EU was prepared to contemplate it, and the extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day. Then there is Labour's proposal for a permanent customs union - Mrs May has always ruled that out, but if enough MPs get behind it, it might be an option, although, again, it would need Article 50 to be extended to allow for more talks. Unlikely, given her track record of doggedly ploughing on against the odds - but if she is defeated by a heavy margin on 11 December she may feel she has no other option. There would then be a Tory leadership contest, which would turn into a fight to the death between the Leave and Remain wings of the party, with profound effects on the future of Brexit and, indeed, the country.  Jacob Rees-Mogg's band of Brexiteers famously failed to reach the magic 48 letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest last month. But if she tries to cling on after a significant defeat on 11 December, more MPs could add their names to the list, forcing a no-confidence vote that she might struggle to win. MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit.  At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton.  But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too.  However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by the Political Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000.  The Electoral Commission's recommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day.  This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks. So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree. This is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected.  But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, \"with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem\" of a deadlocked parliament.  That will be the other critical factor at play.  Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait.  There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later. Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government - Labour has said they will table such a motion if Mrs May loses on 11 December.  This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it. This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in. Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit. Another idea that has been floated is a \"negotiated no deal\" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms.  Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote.  Because Parliament will have to come to a view.  As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: \"We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view.  \"I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament.\"  Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process. Instead, she faces a fraught few days and a vote that will define the country's future for many years.  Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons.  But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.

The government delayed the crucial vote on the Brexit deal, originally scheduled for 11 November, because they were going to lose. The PM has been back to Brussels and she still hopes to get \"additional reassurance\" from the EU about the backstop. That's the part of the withdrawal agreement that would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland if no trade agreement is reached between the EU and UK by the end of the \"transition period\". The government now says MPs will get the chance to vote on the deal in the week starting 14 January 2019. The Brexit deal cannot be legally implemented until it has been approved in the House of Commons. What would happen if it was rejected? The EU Withdrawal Act, passed by Parliament in June, sets out some rules. The government would have to produce a new plan of action within 21 days and then allow a further vote within another seven sitting days in the House of Commons.  However, the government could act much more quickly than that. And it's possible that political events would transform the situation. Following a government defeat in the Commons on 4 December, MPs would now have more say in proposing alternatives to any plan of action  - but these would still have to be put into law by the government. There's also been a suggestion that MPs could express their views in a series of \"indicative votes\" on a variety of options. Again, though, these would not be binding. The European Court of Justice has ruled that it would be legal for the UK to unilaterally revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit (without the need for agreement from the other 27 EU countries). With the government still committed to Brexit, it's very likely that a major event such as a further referendum or change of government would have to happen before such a move. In the event that MPs eventually do reject the Brexit deal, some of the most likely options are set out below. If nothing else happens, the default position would be a no-deal Brexit. The law is already in place which means the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. And, in any case, EU rules mean the UK would leave then. The government would probably want to pass some legislation to prepare for no-deal but that's not strictly essential.  If MPs aren't happy with the plan they could try to put pressure on the government to change its mind. Their ultimate sanction, if the government wouldn't budge, would be a vote of no confidence - see section four below. If MPs vote against the deal, the government could propose to negotiate a new Brexit deal. This would not be a question of carrying out minor tweaks and having a second vote. That approach now seems less realistic after the government delayed the vote so Theresa May could go to Brussels and seek clarifications.  Instead, there could be a complete renegotiation that would take some time and might well require an extension of Article 50 to delay Brexit. This would require two key steps. First, the UK would have to make a request to the EU for an extension. This could be granted but only if all EU countries agree at a vote of the EU Council. Alternative ways to break Brexit impasse The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Number crunching: Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? A guide to where we are with Brexit Second, the government would have to table a statutory instrument to change the definition of \"exit day\" in the EU Withdrawal Act. MPs would get a chance to vote on this change. If the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, the government would have to plump for one of the other options instead. Theresa May could decide that the best way out of the deadlock would be to hold an early general election - in order to get a political mandate for her deal. She doesn't have the power just to call an election. But, as in 2017, she could ask MPs to vote for an early election under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. Two-thirds of all MPs would need to support the move. The earliest date for the election would be 25 working days later but it could be after that - the prime minister would choose the precise date. As with the \"renegotiate\" plan, this course of action could also involve a request to the EU to extend Article 50. And it's not the only way an election could come about. If the proposed deal is rejected the opposition could call for a formal vote of no confidence. Mrs May could even call for a vote herself to try to reinforce her authority. The rules, under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, mean there are several possible outcomes if the government loses a formal vote of no confidence. If no government is able to win a vote of confidence within 14 days - and that means neither the existing government nor any alternative - then there would be an early general election. The earliest possible date for the election would be 25 working days later. However, if the government wins a confidence motion within this 14-day period, perhaps by offering some new concession, it carries on. The final possibility is a change of government. That could mean another minority Conservative government with a different prime minister, a coalition government, or a minority government of a different party which had the agreement of others to back it in a confidence vote. Clearly, any new government could have a different Brexit policy so the various options could be re-opened. The government could instead choose to have another referendum. As with a renegotiation or early election, this might well require an extension to Article 50. It's probably already too late to hold a referendum before 29 March. And it can't just happen automatically. The rules for referendums are set out in a law called the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. There would have to be a new piece of legislation to make a referendum happen and to determine the rules, such as who would be allowed to vote. It couldn't be rushed through because there has to be time for the Electoral Commission to consider and advise on the referendum question. The question is then defined in the legislation. Once the legislation has been passed the referendum couldn't happen immediately either. There would have to be a statutory \"referendum period\" before the vote takes place. Experts at University College London's Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps above is about 22 weeks. Even if that could be shortened a little, it would still take us well beyond the end of March. As well as the various options for what could happen with Brexit, there could be a lot of other political events going on as well. Now Theresa May has survived a challenge to her leadership the Conservative Party's rules mean she won't face another for 12 months. But she could always decide to resign anyway if she can't get her deal through and she's not prepared to change course. That would trigger a Conservative leadership campaign which would result in the appointment of a new prime minister. She might also come under pressure to resign if MPs pass a \"censure motion\" - that would be a bit like a no confidence vote but without the same automatic consequences. Again this could lead to a change in prime minister or even a change in government. Whoever ended up in charge would still face the same basic range of Brexit options though.

But President Trump was talking in particular about the prospects for future trade agreements.  \"Right now, if you look at the (Brexit) deal,\" he said, \"they (the UK) may not be able to trade with us, and that wouldn't be a good thing.\" Of course, that shouldn't be taken literally - it doesn't mean no trade at all. But as long as the UK remains in a transition period after Brexit, or in a temporary customs union, it will not be able to implement its own free trade deals, cutting or removing tariffs on goods, with the United States or any other third country.   That much is clear, but trade deals aren't just about tariffs. They are also about rules and regulations (known as non-tariff barriers) which are often more important.  And from an \"America-first\" perspective, it's fair to assume that the president thinks Theresa May's Brexit deal makes it more likely that the UK will stay fairly close to the EU in the long term, by following the same (or very similar) regulations in various sectors of the economy. That is a key point. Because the closer the UK stays to the EU's common rules and standards, the more difficult it will be for it to move closer to the rules and standards followed in the United States.   We're talking here not just about examples which come up regularly, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef (broadly speaking, both are allowed in the US and not in the EU), but also about industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  Many big businesses in the UK want to stay close to all those EU rules (its regulatory framework) because the EU is a huge consumer market right on their doorstep. And they tend to follow the EU rules for their global operations because that simply makes things easier.  The numbers are also instructive here. Last year the UK exported \u00a3274bn of goods and services to the rest of the EU and imported \u00a3341bn. The figures for trade with the United States were \u00a3112bn of exports and \u00a370bn of imports.  So, the EU will remain the UK's most important trading partner for some time to come. And if the president was hoping Brexit would mean a more decisive break between the UK and the EU, he may be disappointed. Hence, \"a great deal for the EU\". There is genuine competition in this field between the United States and the European Union.  The EU may not be a military or diplomatic superpower, but it is a regulatory superpower.  That means one of the big choices the UK will have to make in its negotiations on post-Brexit trade agreements is which regulatory and legal orbit it chooses to operate in.  It's not an absolute \"either-or\" decision, but the UK will have to lean one way or the other.  The non-binding political declaration on future UK-EU trade, approved by EU leaders on Sunday, makes this clear.  The EU is insisting on various \"level playing field\" conditions to ensure that the UK cannot gain a competitive advantage by continuing to have privileged access to the EU market without following its rules.  The political declaration says the level playing field should cover \"state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change and relevant tax matters\", and a separate statement issued by the leaders of the EU27 emphasises that they will \"demonstrate particular vigilance\" to ensure that these conditions are followed to the letter.   The declaration also recognises that the UK will develop an independent trade policy in the future. But it stresses that if the goal is to have frictionless trade with the EU, that will depend on how closely aligned the UK remains with the single market and the customs union.  We're back to the unresolved argument about the right balance between economic access and sovereignty.  So where does that leave the UK's future trade relationship with the US? Downing Street points out that there have already been five working-group meetings to discuss the matter.  But this may not be quite the Brexit that Donald Trump had in mind.

The Brexit secretary accused the European Commission of \"shooting itself in the foot just to prove that the gun works\". He said throwing the UK out of Galileo would delay it by three years and cost the EU \u00a31bn more. The UK has played a major role in developing satellites for Galileo, an alternative to the US GPS system. But Brussels has cited legal issues about sharing sensitive information with a non-member state for its decision to shut British firms out of the project. Brussels has also said it will restrict access to encrypted signals from Galileo. The move has sparked a furious reaction from the UK government, which is demanding \u00a31bn back from the EU and has threatened to build a rival satellite system, at an estimated cost of \u00a35bn. In a speech on post-Brexit security co-operation, Mr Davis said: \"We should be able, as trusted allies and friends of Europe to get an agreement that allows sensitive information to be shared.\" He said British companies were being discriminated against and blocked from contracts - despite the fact that excluding the UK would delay Galileo by three years or more. \"This is not an issue isolated to Galileo,\" he added. \"The same is at risk of happening with the new European Defence Fund.\" The UK had originally opposed the creation of the European Defence Fund, which co-ordinates joint operations by member states. The government wants to continue contributing troops, equipment and money to overseas EU military operations after Brexit. But Mr Davis said the EU's attitude to \"third countries\" - which the UK will become after Brexit - was standing in the way of that ambition.  \"All of these unhelpful precedents and assumptions on how third countries should operate with the EU is hindering projects that would help the entire continent,\" he said in his speech. The UK had also opposed the creation of Galileo, when it was first proposed 18 years ago, but Britain's space industry had been a major player in the project, which is meant to be fully operational by 2026. It comes as the European Commission announced plans to pump an extra \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.4bn) into space projects, including Galileo and the Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, which will be delivered in partnership with the European Space Agency. Britain will remain a member of the European Space Agency, which is not an EU body, after Brexit, and is willing to pay a fee of around \u00a31bn to the European Commission to remain part of its space plans. But the Commission's spending proposals on are based on the assumption that it will get no more cash from the UK after Brexit.

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word Brexit A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting. Get the results in full. England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other.  It has since grown to become a \"single market\" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. A European court has ruled that the UK can decide to stop the process. Alternatively it can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has put it into British law. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019 - it's the law, regardless of whether there is a deal with the EU or not. Stopping Brexit would require a change in the law in the UK.  The European Court of Justice ruled on 10 December 2018 that the UK could cancel the Article 50 Brexit process without the permission of the other 27 EU members, and remain a member of the EU on its existing terms, provided the decision followed a \"democratic process\". Prime Minister Theresa May has warned Conservative MPs thinking of voting against the deal she has reached with the EU that they risk \"no Brexit at all\". This is a reference to another referendum, which is backed by the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru the Green Party, a small number of Conservatives and larger group of Labour MPs, who want the public to be given the final say, with the option to remain in the EU.  They are trying to get the Labour leadership to back them - but Jeremy Corbyn wants to try and force a general election first. The EU might agree to extend Article 50 if its leaders thought there was a chance the UK could end up staying in, possibly through another referendum, but it would only be by a few months. The UK's main opposition party, Labour, wants to force a general election and, after winning it, go back to Brussels to negotiate its version of Brexit. That would also require Brexit day being pushed back from 29 March, something the EU might agree to, to give a new UK government the chance to make its case. If Labour can't force a general election it has said it will push for another referendum, but it has yet to say what it thinks the question on the ballot paper should be. After months of negotiation, the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts. A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU. It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated \u00a339bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border.  A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.   The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab. MPs have been debating the deal but the PM postponed a Commons vote scheduled for 11 December to seek \"further assurances\" from the EU for MPs about the post-Brexit plan for the Irish border (see below for more about that). Downing Street says the vote  will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Theresa May has been operating without a Common majority since the 2017 general election, relying on the support of Northern Ireland's DUP MPs to back her in key votes. She has faced criticism from Brexiteer MPs in her party since she published her Brexit deal, culminating in them forcing a confidence vote in her as Conservative leader. Mrs May won the vote by 200 to 117, which was enough to keep her as party leader, although the general view has been that she was weakened because it showed a third of the party did not back her. Tory MPs cannot challenge her for another year. However Labour and other opposition parties could call a vote of no confidence in her as prime minister - this would be a vote of all MPs and to succeed would require the DUP MPs and some Tory MPs to abstain or vote to bring their own government down.  It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal. Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work.  The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks. Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that. The UK and EU agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.  The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. If trade talks break down without a deal the UK will remain in the backstop indefinitely, but the UK government says that highly unlikely to happen because it would not be in either side's interests. Nevertheless, the prospect - described by one minister as a \"calculated risk\" - of being unable to quit the EU's customs rules without its say-so has been enough to turn many MPs off Theresa May's deal with the EU. They want the backstop to be ditched - something the government insists is simply not possible. Crucially, the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which keeps Theresa May in power, is against it and has said it will vote against the deal. Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. As things stand, it looks unlikely. Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 100 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its \"money, laws and borders\" but is also the best the UK can get from the EU and that there is no alternative on offer.  She also argues that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry. Alternatively, she says, there will be \"no Brexit at all\". However, Mrs May postponed the scheduled 11 December vote, admitting the deal would have been rejected \"by a significant margin\" because of \"widespread and deep concern\" over the backstop arrangement. Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU.  Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that. Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.  Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that \"Brexit means Brexit\" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018. Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here. David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018.  Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show \"real terms\" increases in prices. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session: The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called \"divorce bill\", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December, 2017: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the \"transition\" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU. It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.  The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This \"Great Repeal Bill\", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill. Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a \"hard border\" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit. So at one extreme, \"hard\" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a \"soft\" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together. The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a \"level playing field\".  Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single market The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals. The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based \"maximum facilitation\" arrangement.  Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators. The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.  Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums. The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a \"cliff-edge\" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers. There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal' An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure. The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal.  Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal. UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about \u00a372. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration plan We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no-deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit. Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a \"transition\" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't. What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals. People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less. A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years. Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a \"sustainable\" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.  The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018.  \"Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,\" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration? Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.  The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel. If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.  No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU. Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was \"democratically unacceptable\" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.  She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal. The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the \"least damaging\" option for the UK economy as a whole. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves. The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called \"divorce bill\" is \u00a339bn.  But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its \"strict international legal obligations\".  The UK could leave without any Brexit \"divorce bill\" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically. State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations. There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money. Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an \"upside\" or \"silver lining\" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the \"customs union\" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued. If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work. After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached. Read more here Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions. The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process. The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the \"direct\" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after Brexit After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements. The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years. The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit.  BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out. The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.  They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations. Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.  One of the main principles of EU membership is \"free movement\", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of \"ever closer union\" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a \"United States of Europe\".  Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.  He said the deal would give Britain \"special\" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference. Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.  The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.   Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.  They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone. Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.  Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.  Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - \"much to France's chagrin\", she says. Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products. Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version. In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to \u00a34.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was \u00a38.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.  The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was \u00a35.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check. David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.  In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS. The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date.  Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.   The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws.  Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: \"All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.\" The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations. The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies. Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \"The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.\"Brexit: All you need to know So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics. Ged, from Liverpool, suspects \"red tape\" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs \u00a34.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (\u00a34.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (\u00a32.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list. Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.  Brexit may also generate \"red tape\" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries. Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of \u00a310bn a year.  But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it would shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.  This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US. Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.  This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was \u00a3350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim. Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as \"scaremongering\" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of \"home grown\" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting.  Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a \"Brexit dividend\" was helping fund a larger-than-planned \u00a320bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023. This is a question from Barry.  The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate. The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction. The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members. It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here. As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well. After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity. For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners. The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.  The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.  The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other. In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU.  Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war. They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a \"free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas\". The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world. In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU. View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force. View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go. But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door. As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area. Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities. The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place. If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live. For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card. If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card. The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status. So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK. Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK. So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions. There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years. Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, \"I paid in there\", and that will count. That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements. Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements. If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension. Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports. Declan, an Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports. The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time. Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers. All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future. It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it. And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice. But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making. So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45274972", "content": "Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has set out what he called \"practical and proportionate\" advice in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The guidance includes instructions for businesses who could face extra paperwork at borders and contingency plans to avoid medicine shortages. Britons visiting the EU could also face extra credit card charges. Ministers say a deal is the most likely outcome but that \"short-term disruption\" is possible without one. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason described the publication as a \"vast swirling porridge of detail - much of it at a technical level, advising individual industries about the manner in which they are regulated in the event of a no-deal Brexit\". Labour said a no-deal outcome would be \"catastrophic\" and a \"complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain\". Just after the documents were released, Chancellor Philip Hammond reiterated a warning from his department of a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years under a no-deal Brexit scenario, in a letter to the Treasury Committee. The timing of that release angered pro-Brexit MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the Treasury was trying to stop Brexit, and that it consistently painted a bleak picture \"because they are frightened of taking responsibility for managing the economy without the crutch of the EU\". In the 24 documents, which cover industries including medicine, finance and farming, it says: Mr Raab said reaching a deal with the EU was the \"overriding priority\" and \"by far the most likely outcome\" but that \"we must be ready to consider the alternative\". He also dismissed what he said were \"wilder claims\" about the impact of not reaching a deal, including that it could spark a \"sandwich famine\" in the UK. \"Let me assure you that, contrary to one of the wilder claims, you will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the Army to maintain food supplies,\" he said. The UK will cease to be a member of the EU on 29 March 2019. With several sticking points remaining in negotiations, there has increasingly been talk of what happens if there is no agreement in place, including police chiefs warning of a risk to the public if the UK loses access to EU-wide crime databases and Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying no deal would be \"highly undesirable\". Pro-Brexit campaigners have described the warnings as \"Project Fear\" - saying the UK has nothing to fear from leaving without a trade deal and falling back on World Trade Organization rules. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that such an arrangement \"would suffice\" and said the risks had been \"absurdly overstated\". His fellow Brexiteer John Redwood said stockpiling six weeks worth of medical supplies was \"a bit over the top\" but that the government was being \"ultra cautious\". Please upgrade your browser Analysis by BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar This didn't seem a comfortable moment for Dominic Raab. The Brexit secretary campaigned for Leave, and is a true believer in the cause. Yet here he was, setting out plans to cope with a British failure to reach the kind of deal Brexiteers once claimed would be easy to accomplish. Again and again, the Brexit department's guidance refers to the \"unlikely event\" of Brexit without an EU deal - but Dominic Raab conceded it could happen. The risk was real. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has suggested that outcome is more likely than not.  The Brexit secretary may disagree on the level of risk, but could not deny that it would lead to higher costs and a fresh burden of red tape on businesses, scientific and medical research and individuals. Read John's blog on the no-deal papers The European Commission said Brexit would lead to disruption \"with a deal or without a deal\". \"That's why everybody, and in particular economic operators, need to be prepared,\" it said. The commission has already published its own assessment of no deal, saying there would be \"no specific arrangement\" for EU citizens living in the UK or for UK citizens in the EU and warning of \"significant delays\" at borders. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Mr Raab's speech was \"thin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement\". \"A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the government's negotiating strategy,\" he said. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said a no-deal Brexit would cause \"huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage\", and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: \"This isn't project fear by critics of Brexit, this is the government itself and independent bodies pointing to the damage that will be caused.\" The National Farmers' Union warned of a \"disastrous\" cliff edge scenario for the UK food supply chain. Business group the CBI said: \"These papers show that those who claim crashing out of the EU on World Trade Organisation rules is acceptable live in a world of fantasy, where facts are not allowed to challenge ideology.\" Pointing to the possibility of new credit card charges, Lord Adonis of the People's Vote campaign, said: \"Every time a new Brexit paper is published, more people are made worse off\". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the reports confirmed no-deal Brexit was not a credible option, as it would be \"devastating for working people\".", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46608952", "content": "Theresa May is now thought to be in favour of giving MPs a vote on alternatives to her plans when they debate her Brexit deal. The prime minister was previously thought to be against this idea. But sources have told the BBC she wants the \"meaningful vote\" planned for the third week of January to be a \"moment of reckoning\" for Brexit. It comes as the cabinet announced it was stepping up preparations in case there is a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. The votes would be on amendments to the motion on her Brexit deal - and would take place before the key vote on her plan. The Brexit deal Theresa May has reached with the EU has to be passed by Parliament but most MPs - including many on her own side - are against it. She had been planning to present Parliament with a choice between her deal and no-deal, hoping that enough MPs would swallow their objections and get behind her version of Brexit. But MPs are showing few signs of changing their minds - with some hoping that the next step after her deal being rejected would be leaving without a deal, others hoping for a fresh referendum and some backing alternative deals like the ones Norway or Canada have with the EU. So rather than wait for what seems like an inevitable defeat, she is thought to be planning a new approach. The prime minister does not believe any of the factions criticising her plan have enough support to get their own version of Brexit through Parliament. By allowing them to put forward their proposals and vote on them, she is hoping they will be defeated and her plan will emerge by a process of elimination as the best and only alternative to leaving without a deal. By BBC Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar On all sides at Westminster, MPs feel sure her plan is doomed to defeat.  Many - including some in her own Cabinet - want other ideas: a Norway-style Brexit which leaves the UK closely tied to the EU, say, or a referendum, or no deal, put to MPs after that happens.  The prime minister's formula might flush out those who are quietly waiting for her plan to fail before offering their own ideas as a solution.  She wants, in effect, a moment of reckoning for Brexit, with all the rival outcomes debated and voted upon when MPs discuss and decide on her plan next month.  If MPs reject every plan - and that is possible - she might just be able to continue the fight for her own. Several cabinet ministers have publicly suggested alternative next steps if Mrs May's plan is rejected. At a marathon cabinet meeting earlier: Mrs May was originally planning to put her plan to a Commons vote last week but pulled it at the last minute over fears it would be defeated, sparking widespread outrage among MPs. \"Last time, for one reason or another, people only set out what they opposed. Next time could be an opportunity for people to set down what they support - and vote on it,\"  a senior source close to Mrs May said. Downing Street is also hoping to get more reassurances from Brussels that any outcome that keeps the UK tied to EU rules - as part of measures to ensure there is no return to a physical Northern Ireland border, will be temporary.

But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the government remained committed to the target. He said the aim was to get net migration down to \"sustainable\" levels. The final version of the much-delayed immigration plan, which aims to end free movement from the EU after Brexit, has yet to be agreed. Ministers had insisted it would be issued this week, before the Christmas break, but it is unclear if that will now happen as officials work round the clock to finalise the plans.  The goal of cutting net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - was introduced by David Cameron in 2011 and was a Conservative manifesto commitment at last year's general election. The BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said removing it from the immigration white paper would be a \"hugely symbolic step\". The government has never come close to meeting the target and has faced repeated calls to drop it.   The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has fallen since Britain voted to leave the EU, but more people coming from elsewhere means the overall migration rate is unchanged and stands at 273,000 a year. Home Secretary Sajid Javid will reportedly use the immigration white paper to set out plans to cut net migration from the EU by as much as 80%. He wants to limit the number of low and medium-skilled workers coming to the UK from EU countries by saying they must earn at least \u00a330,000 a year. But there will be no cap on the number of highly skilled workers, reports suggest. This will create a level playing field with immigration from outside the EU, the government says. But some businesses have warned of labour shortages, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark are arguing for the proposed \u00a330,000 minimum salary for low-skilled workers to be reduced, according to The Daily Mail.  By Political Reporter Brian Wheeler The Conservatives went into the 2010 general election with a pledge to return to the \"sustainable\" levels of net migration seen in the 1990s. David Cameron promised to meet the target \"no ifs, no buts\". But the idea has always had its critics. A country can only control how many people come in, not how many emigrate. And Mr Cameron only had limited control over those coming in anyway, because of EU free movement rules. But focusing on net migration did shift attention away from the far higher immigration figure - 630,000 in 2017 - which had previously dominated the headlines.   Communities Secretary James Brokenshire refused to speculate on the contents of the draft white paper, which have been shown to the cabinet for the first time this week. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are committed to seeing net migration reduced to those sustainable numbers that we saw back before 1998 when it was less than 100,000.\" He said the government had focused on that number \"because that is what is sustainable in the long-term\". Global employment consultancy Mercer has predicted a UK workforce shortage of 1.9 million by 2025, if the government remains committed to its 100,000 target and demand for labour continues to rise at the same rate as it has for the past 10 years. But the company claims there is an \"untapped\" workforce of 1.8 million UK-born workers, if firms started recruiting more workers aged over 50, women, and people with disabilities.

Because this week, and likely in the early weeks of next year, you might need it. A pattern is becoming more and more distinct that shows the many rival factions in Parliament sweating to find the latest, the most cunning, the most expeditious procedure to try to get their way - whether that's the opposition, or disgruntled Tories, both in different ways making life tricky for the government.  We've just witnessed another case in point. Jeremy Corbyn was, we were told, going to lodge an attempt to force a no confidence vote, simply in the prime minister, in fury that she had delayed Parliament having a say on her Brexit agreement.    That's not, as you understand, the scary sounding no-confidence motion of old that could collapse a government.  But a vote only on her credibility, and that alone, which if lost, of course, would be enormously embarrassing. But (depending which expert you believe) which would only have the power to embarrass, not do anything else.  Except, only an hour after the leader's office let us know that was coming, the prime minister announced a timetable for the vote on her big Brexit compromise.  This wasn't a huge surprise as it was anticipated in the press some days ago. But nonetheless it seemed to take Labour by surprise.  Because the Jeremy Corbyn threat of a confidence motion in her was not, at that stage, forthcoming.  Spin forward an hour or so and his close ally John McDonnell was doing the rounds, celebrating how they had forced her to give a timetable at last. Yet, then just before 6pm, after the anger of backbenchers was apparent on all sides, the Labour leader decided to go for it after all.  Then within a couple of hours, both the Tory Brexiteer group the ERG and the DUP, their supposed allies, went public to say they would back the PM.  The chances of Labour winning their vote were fading fast. You might have thought that would therefore give the government a chance to, as one Tory MP suggested, \"rub Corbyn's nose in it\". And then just after 9pm Number 10 sources made it clear they won't allow the debate anyway, saying Labour are just \"playing silly political games\".  Not to be outdone, the other opposition parties have just added a final twist, by putting down an amendment to the Labour motion (which, remember, won't be debated now) that would - if then it was selected by the Speaker in this fantasy debate - upgrade the vote to a real, full-blown motion of confidence in the government.  Keeping up? I don't blame if you if it all seems like procedural nonsense.  And frankly, you might not be completely wrong. But what it suggests is that despite widespread frustration on all sides, Jeremy Corbyn is so far stopping short of taking a real shot at toppling May's administration, and is unlikely to do so unless and until he thinks he can win.  For her part, Theresa May is unlikely to budge on her plan, unless and until she is forced to do so.  To the immense irritation of both their supporters and their rivals, even though the Brexit clock is running down, neither of the main party leaders are willing to take the kind of radical move that might unblock the gridlock.  Parliamentary shenanigans are no substitute for the decisions that may have to be taken in a matter of weeks.  ", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-44615404", "content": "A key part of the Brexit negotiations was about the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Last month, EU leaders approved a withdrawal deal with the UK that includes an agreement on the Irish border. Both sides committed to avoiding the return of a \"hard border\" - physical checks or infrastructure - after Brexit. This is where the controversial \"backstop\" comes in. The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions. The UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards. But, after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The UK government does not want this to happen. The EU has also said it does not want any hardening of the border. However, the UK's current red lines, which include leaving the customs union and the single market, make that very difficult. Well, you could try to put up a safety net. The backstop is that safety net - an arrangement that will apply to the Irish border after Brexit, if a wider deal or technological solution cannot keep it as frictionless as it is today. An agreement on the backstop is important because the EU won't agree to a transitional period and substantive trade talks until it is in place. The UK and the EU said a backstop is needed - they both signed up to it in December 2017. They also agreed on what it needs to achieve - maintaining cross-border cooperation, supporting the all-island economy and protecting the Good Friday peace agreement. But beyond that there have been major differences between the two sides. The EU originally proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, continually emphasised that this backstop could only apply to Northern Ireland. That is an understatement. If a backstop only applied to Northern Ireland, then the customs and regulatory border would essentially be drawn down the middle of the Irish Sea. Goods coming into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK would have to be checked to make sure they met EU standards. Any separate status for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK is seen as potentially damaging to the union as a whole. As such, Prime Minister Theresa May continually rejected the EU's proposal saying it would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. She suggested a backstop that would see the UK, as a whole, remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. Her proposal, published in June, contained nothing about single market regulatory issues, which are probably more important than customs in terms of maintaining a soft border. With scepticism. Mr Barnier said it could not even qualify as a backstop since the issue of regulatory alignment was not addressed. However, he did not rule out some sort of long-term customs relationship with the UK. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said that the backstop could not have a time limit. After months of an impasse, on 14 November 2018, Theresa May said her cabinet had backed a draft deal between UK-EU negotiators that included agreement on a backstop. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, if another solution cannot be found by the end of the transition period in December 2020. That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - unless and until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Please upgrade your browser On 25 November, EU leaders approved the agreement at a special summit in Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said anyone in Britain who thought the bloc might offer improved terms if MPs in Westminster rejected the deal would be \"disappointed\". The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the deal was the \"next best outcome\" to the UK staying in the EU and allowed for an orderly withdrawal. Not at all. Theresa May faced a backlash from MPs at Westminster, and several of her own ministers resigned in protest at the agreement on the backstop. The DUP, a Northern Ireland unionist party that props up Mrs May's minority government, also abstained on key budget votes in a bid to warn the government to \"bin the backstop\". It has repeatedly said it would not accept any additional Northern Ireland-only checks, because it is concerned that any differences between NI and Great Britain could threaten the union. However, it has been urged by business and agri-food groups in Northern Ireland to support the government's plan. Brexiteers in other parties also expressed concerns about the backstop, fearing the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. On 5 December 2018, the government published the full legal advice it received on the backstop, after Parliament voted to find ministers in contempt for withholding it after a binding Commons vote. Much of what it said repeated what has been known since the draft withdrawal deal was published. But it did state that NI alone could end up in a customs union with the EU under the terms of the backstop, and the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said entering into it would be a \"political decision\". MPs opposed to the deal said the full advice had vindicated their position. But the prime minister again defended her plan, and said the backstop was a necessary \"last resort\" to protect commitments made to Northern Ireland in the Good Friday Agreement. The prime minister still has to get the deal agreed by Parliament. A vote was due to take place on Tuesday, 11 December, but Theresa May postponed it after conceding the deal faced certain defeat in the Commons. After surviving a vote of confidence in her leadership, she will travel to Brussels for an EU summit to seek legally binding pledges on the backstop. It is understood the EU will not renegotiate the deal but may be willing to give greater assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop.  Ultimately, if the backstop deal does not stick, then there is no withdrawal agreement and no transition period. That means a hard, possibly chaotic, Brexit. At that point, the EU and the Irish government would have some difficult decisions to make about what happens at the border or to Irish goods going into the wider single market.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46586673", "content": "MPs will vote on the UK's Brexit deal in the week beginning 14 January, Theresa May has told Parliament. The vote was due to be held last week but was put on hold after Mrs May admitted she was set to lose. Announcing a new date, she said the EU had made it clear the Irish backstop was \"not a plot to trap the UK\", and urged MPs to see Brexit through. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would table a motion of no confidence in the PM for delaying the vote. He told the Commons it was unacceptable that MPs had to wait another month before having their say on Mrs May's deal. He added the PM had \"led the country into a national crisis\".  Mr Corbyn's motion - due to be tabled on Tuesday - calls on MPs to declare they have \"no confidence in the prime minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straight away\" on the Brexit deal. It focuses on Mrs May personally, rather than the government. BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said that while the motion - if successful - could not end in the collapse of the government, \"it would be another embarrassment for the PM if Labour ends up winning the day\". Earlier, Mr Corbyn said a month would be wasted since the original 11 December vote was postponed, with \"not a single word renegotiated and not a single reassurance given\".   \"The deal is unchanged and is not going to change,\" he said.  \"The House must get on with the vote and move on to consider the realistic alternatives.\" Mrs May's Brexit deal sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU - on 29 March 2019 - and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations between the UK and the EU. But the deal only comes into force if both parliaments approve it. In a Commons statement, Mrs May said MPs would resume the debate - halted last week - in the week of 7 January. The \"meaningful\" vote is due to take place in the following week.  Mrs May told MPs: \"It is now only just over 14 weeks until the UK leaves the EU and I know many members of this House are concerned that we need to take a decision soon.\"  She said she had won fresh guarantees at last week's EU summit over measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and she hoped to secure additional \"political and legal assurances\" in the coming weeks. Earlier on Monday, an EU spokesman said it had provided the \"clarifications\" requested on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop and \"no further meetings were foreseen\". During her statement, Mrs May faced calls from across the House for the vote to be held immediately. The SNP's Ian Blackford said the government was a \"laughing stock\" and Parliament needed to \"take control of the situation and find a solution\". Former education secretary Justine Greening said Mrs May had led the UK down a \"political cul-de-sac\" and suggested that criticising alternatives to her deal was \"pointless\", given the level of opposition to it among MPs. \"She now isn't just not listening, she is not allowing debate,\" she said. Former cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey urged the PM to accelerate planning for a no-deal exit while another former minister, Andrew Mitchell, urged her to consider suspending the Brexit process to allow for further negotiations.  Please upgrade your browser But Mrs May won support from one \"previously sceptical\" Brexiteer, Sir Edward Leigh, who said her efforts to secure a legally-binding protocol on the Irish backstop might pay off, urging her to \"keep calm and carry on\".  Earlier, No 10 said it had \"no plans\" for votes on other Brexit outcomes if the PM's deal is rejected after it emerged David Cameron had given advice to his successor. The BBC understands Mr Cameron has been in touch with Mrs May about how a series of \"indicative votes\" on various different Brexit outcomes could be handled if there was deadlock over the terms of the UK's exit.  Potential \"Plan B\" options include: The PM is coming under pressure from ministers to \"test the will of Parliament\" through a series of non-binding votes - which would see MPs pass judgement on the options available in the hope of identifying the most popular.  Business Secretary Greg Clark said he backed Mrs May's deal but if Parliament was implacably opposed, it should be \"invited to say what it would agree with\".  \"Businesses expect MPs to take responsibility rather than just be critics,\" he told Radio 4's Today. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd made the same point, saying \"all options\" should remain on the table and if the deal was rejected \"let's think about how we test the will of Parliament to find out where the majority is\" Calls for another referendum have grown in recent weeks amid signs a majority of MPs are opposed both to the deal on the table but also leaving the EU without any kind of agreement.  Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said a new referendum would be the \"first opportunity for people to vote on the facts, not on the fantasy and the fabrication\".  But Mrs May said another vote would do \"irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics\" and not settle the issue. \"Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,\" she said. \"Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.\" There were reports in the Sunday newspapers that two of Mrs May's key allies were planning for another referendum, in the event that her deal cannot get MPs' backing. Both men - Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell and Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington - distanced themselves from the reports. Separately, more than 60 MPs from various parties have written to the PM urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying it would do \"unnecessary economic damage\" to manufacturers in their constituencies.  Speaking in the Commons, ex-minister Jonathan Djanogly said the UK was \"haemorrhaging support and investment\" while Oliver Heald said the EU's \"patronising\" attitude to the UK betrayed a lack of urgency to prevent the disruption of a disorderly Brexit.", "label": "politics"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46584654", "content": "Parliament might have to decide what to do next if Theresa May's Brexit deal is rejected by MPs, cabinet minister Liam Fox has said. The senior Brexiteer said the PM's deal was unlikely to pass through Parliament unless the backstop issue was resolved. He said one option could be a \"free vote\" for MPs. An alternative being widely suggested is another referendum - but Mr Fox told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this was unlikely and would not \"heal division\". Other options backed by different groups of MPs include leaving without a deal, another referendum, or Norway or Canada-style alternative deals. Norway has a very close relationship with the EU but is not a member, while Canada has an extensive trade deal with the bloc.  Education Secretary Damian Hinds has also suggested \"flushing out\" the levels of Parliamentary support for different Brexit options although he told BBC Radio5Live's Pienaar's Politics there was not a majority for any of them. And Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, who is part of the anti-Brexit \"Best for Britain\" campaign, said: \"When even Dr Fox does not rule out free votes and encourages the idea of indicative votes in Parliament, the Brexit project is clearly in jeopardy.\"  By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason What we are witnessing is a bursting out in public of conversations that have been happening for a while, at a senior level, in private. They can be summarised like this: 'What on earth do we do next?'  One idea, now floated by three cabinet ministers in public, and others privately, is a series of so called \"indicative votes\".  These would flush out Parliament's view on a range of options which could include different models of Brexit: something akin to Norway's relationship with the EU for instance, or Canada's looser one. Another referendum and no deal are other possibilities. Some ponder doing this before the vote on the prime minister's deal, in the hope it highlights that her plan is the only workable Brexit deal achievable now. \"Things are not as hopeless as they look,\" one cabinet minister told me. But when I wished them a merry Christmas and a happy new year, that word 'happy' was met with a wry smile. None of this is remotely straight forward. On the possibility of another referendum, International Trade Secretary Mr Fox said one could result in a narrow Remain win on a lower turnout, in which case, \"People like me will be immediately demanding that it's best of three - where does that end up?\" It comes after Theresa May accused former Labour PM Tony Blair of undermining Brexit negotiations by calling for another referendum amid continuing calls for one to be held to solve the impasse over the UK's exit from the European Union.   Two of Mrs May's key allies - chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and her effective second-in-command David Lidington - distanced themselves from reports they were involved in planning for a new referendum.  On Thursday about 10 Labour MPs met Mr Lidington to argue for another public vote. Mr Lidington tweeted that he had told the Commons last week that another referendum would be \"divisive\" and would not guarantee a \"decisive\" ending to the debate.  Mr Barwell also used Twitter to say he did not want another referendum and was not planning one. Mrs May met EU leaders on Thursday - after postponing a Commons vote on the withdrawal deal she has negotiated, fearing its heavy defeat. The government says the Commons vote will go ahead in January, as talks continue with the EU on the issue of the Irish border \"backstop\". The backstop is an insurance policy in the withdrawal deal to prevent the return of a hard border with Northern Ireland if no trade deal is reached - but many of Mrs May's MPs say they cannot support it, arguing it would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. EU leaders have said the deal is \"not open for renegotiation\" - but that there could be some further clarification. Mr Fox said talks would continue over Christmas and the new year. He said it was \"clear\" that the EU understood the problem, and it was now a question of finding a \"mechanism\" that would remove MPs' concerns, without which, he suggested it would not be worth putting it to a Commons vote \"knowing it would be rejected\". If the deal could not get through the Commons, he said: \"Parliament would have to decide on the alternatives.\"  Meanwhile, Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne told the BBC his party would be trying to bring the MPs' \"meaningful vote\" on the deal forward to this week.  The Labour leadership is under pressure from other opposition parties to call for a vote of no confidence in the government. But Mr Gwynne said: \"We can't move to the next stage until Parliament has decided whether or not to back the prime minister's deal.\" Asked whether his party would campaign for Brexit under a Labour deal if there were to be another referendum, he said: \"Let's wait and see. These things are moving very quickly. \"We are a democratic party and we will put our decision to the party members in a democratic way before we decide what the next steps are.\" Please upgrade your browser Labour's official position is to argue for a general election if Mrs May's deal cannot get through the Commons but to keep all options open if that doesn't happen - including another referendum.

Zuma continued: \"His contribution to the struggle for liberation will never be forgotten.\" Born in the South African town of Witbank in 1939, Masekela was inspired to learn the trumpet after seeing Kirk Douglas play Bix Beiderbecke in the 1950 film Young Man with a Horn. He persuaded one of his teachers - the anti-apartheid crusader Father Trevor Huddleston - to buy him an instrument, promising to stay out of trouble in return. In 1960, aged 21, he left South Africa to begin what would be 30 years in exile from the land of his birth. Under the tutelage of Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong, he was encouraged to develop his own unique style. In 1967, he performed at the Monterey Pop Festival alongside Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Ravi Shankar, The Who and Jimi Hendrix.  The following year, his instrumental single Grazing in the Grass topped the charts in the US and became a worldwide hit.

In 2017 The Cranberries announced a tour including dates in Europe, the UK, and the US.  However, in May - shortly into the European tour - the group had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as a result of O'Riordan's health issues. The official Cranberries website cited \"medical reasons associated with a back problem\" preventing singer Dolores O'Riordan from performing.  But just before Christmas O'Riordan had posted on Facebook saying she was \"feeling good\" and had done her \"first bit of gigging in months\", leading fans to believe she would soon be performing again.

The singer was arrested over an alleged air rage incident in 2014 but was released without charge, after a stewardess was reportedly attacked on a flight from New York to Shannon, County Clare. O'Riordan was taken to hospital in Limerick after being questioned by police and later discharged. Two years later, O'Riordan was ordered to pay 6,000 euros (\u00a35,300) to charity for headbutting a police officer after an alleged air rage incident. She was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2015, which she said explained why she was in a \"manic\" state on the plane.  In an interview in 2013 she said that she had been abused as a child, which led to her developing an eating disorder, and eventually she suffered a breakdown.  She described her family, especially her children, as her \"salvation\".  Irish president Michael D Higgins called her death \"a big loss\", and added O'Riordan's work with The Cranberries \"had an immense influence on rock and pop music in Ireland and internationally\".

Smith's distinctive Mancunian drawl, which featured in his music, also took centre stage when he read out the football scores on the BBC in 2005, after one of his tracks was used to introduce them.  BBC 6 Music will pay tribute to Smith in by broadcasting a classic Fall concert at 02:00 GMT on Saturday; and repeating the documentary The Totally Wired World of The Fall at 13:00 GMT on Sunday.  The latter, which features Smith in conversation with Elizabeth Alker, has already been re-published on iPlayer Radio. By Ian Youngs, arts and entertainment reporter Mark E Smith, the snarling singer and single-minded leader of Manchester post-punk group The Fall, was a rock hero whose drinking and fighting - as well as his ragged but rare musical artistry - became the stuff of legend. Over the past 40 years, great bands have come and gone. Musical trends have waxed and waned. But The Fall - basically Mark E Smith and whoever he hadn't fallen out with at the time - remained belligerently immoveable as the unfashionable but unshrinking mob in the shadows of the music scene. In that time, he hired and fired more than 60 bandmates and released 30 albums of music that normally featured frayed, repetitive guitars and Smith's caustic stream of semi-consciousness.  His pronounced sing-slur made him unlike any other frontman, and he inspired devotion among fans who were drawn to his singular presence and rambling poetry.   Read more Born into a working-class family in Broughton, Salford, Smith grew up in Prestwich, and worked first in a meat factory and then as a shipping clerk on the Manchester docks.   In 1976, inspired by a Sex Pistols gig, he quit the docks for The Fall. Simon Wolstencroft, who was the band's drummer for 11 years, told the BBC Smith was a \"funny guy\" and \"very intelligent\". Smith's ex-wife and former band member Brix Smith Start thanked well-wishers for their messages and said she was just \"taking the news in\".

She was taken to hospital near Paris last month for a severe infection. Gall won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965 representing Luxembourg with the song Wax Doll, Rag Doll (Poup\u00e9e de cire, Poup\u00e9e de son). She enjoyed more international success in 1987 with her tribute to jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald, Ella, Elle l'a. Gall was born in October 1947 into a musical family - her father was singer and songwriter Robert Gall, who penned songs for music legends Edith Piaf and Charles Aznavour, among others.  She was known for her childish smile and sweet voice and, in the words of Le Figaro website, \"embodied the emancipation of French girls in the post-war era\". Her career spanned 50 years and Culture Minister Fran\u00e7oise Nyssen described her as \"a timeless icon of French song\". She was just 16 when her first single, Don't Be So Stupid (Ne Sois Pas Si B\u00eate), sold some 200,000 copies. But it was Gall's Eurovision victory with Poup\u00e9e de cire - written by Serge Gainsbourg, one of the biggest figures in French popular music - that helped catapult her to fame and make her a star on France's Y\u00e9-y\u00e9 (yeah yeah) pop scene, so-called because of its nod to English music at the time. Her death comes a month after the loss of another giant of French music, Johnny Hallyday - widely seen as the leader of the Y\u00e9-y\u00e9 singers. Gall's collaboration with Gainsbourg later came under scrutiny, however, after she admitted she had been too young to fully understand the double meanings of some of his songs.  One of her biggest hits was Les Sucettes (Lollipops), which tells the story of a girl who is \"in paradise\" every time \"that little stick is on her tongue\". Once she realised its full meaning, Gall refused to perform the song and vowed never to work with Gainsbourg again. Her 1987 album Babacar, which included her tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, saw her shoot to international fame.  End of Youtube post  by France Gall et Michel Berger There has been an outpouring of tributes to the singer on social media. Eurovision praised Gall's contribution to the contest and credited her winning entry as being the first pop song to win the show. The song \"had a significant impact on the musical style of songs that were entered into the contest in the years that followed,\" it said in a statement.

Wyngarde played dandy detective Jason King in the 1970s TV show of the same name - which was a partial inspiration for the Austin Powers films. He had numerous stage roles, as well as playing the gold-masked Klytus in Flash Gordon and Timanov in Doctor Who. His agent and manager, Thomas Bowington, described him as \"one of the most unique, original and creative actors\" he had seen. \"As a man, there were few things in life he didn't know.\" \"I sometimes nicknamed him The King because he simply knew everything,\" Bowington added. Wyngarde started his career on stage, in a production on Noel Cowards' Present Laughter at Birmingham's Theatre Royal in 1947; and later starred opposite Richard Burton in the big-screen adaptation of Alexander the Great. In 1959, he starred in ITV's South - which some have claimed was the first gay drama on British television.  Set during the US Civil War, it featured Wyngarde as a Polish army lieutenant Jan Wicziewsky, who must decide who he loves: Miss Regina, a plantation owner's niece; or a tall, rugged officer called Eric MacClure. Broadcast live at a time when homosexuality had not been decriminalised in the UK, the drama received scathing reviews in the press. \"I do NOT see anything attractive in the agonies and ecstasies of a pervert, especially in close-up in my living room,\" noted The Daily Sketch's critic.  #PeterWyngarde being the total legend he was checked himself out of hospital to be with us @BFI last summer, when we screened his incredibly daring role in South (1959) as part of Gross Indecency. He was very frail but energised by the rapturous reception. What a life! pic.twitter.com/CPjrhY9Cwa End of Twitter post  by @simonmccallum1 \"I think you have to give Wyngarde a massive pat on the back in terms of the bravery in taking this role,\" said BFI curator Simon McCallum when South was rediscovered five years ago. The furore over the programme did not affect the actor's career, and he guest-starred in a number of 1960s television shows including The Saint, The Prisoner and The Avengers before debuting Jason King in the spy drama Department S. The character proved so popular that Wyngarde got a spin-off series, which made him a household name in the US and Australia. He started his own fashion column in a daily newspaper and, after Australian women voted him the man they'd most like to have an affair with, was mobbed at Sydney airport. \"It was one of the most terrifying experiences I can remember,\" he later recalled. \"They got me to the ground, tore my clothes, debagged me... I was in hospital for three days.\" Wyngarde was briefly married to actress Dorinda Stevens in the 1950s, and then had a long-term relationship with actor Alan Bates. His career suffered a setback in 1975 when he was arrested and convicted of \"an act of gross indecency\" with a lorry driver. He was fined \u00a375 by magistrates under his real name Cyril Louis Goldbert.  The star said the conviction upset him deeply, but did not affect his career. However, his days as a leading man were largely finished.  He attributed his decline to type-casting by \"small-minded people\", but homophobia was undoubtedly a factor. King remained his best-known character, a globe-trotting playboy with an astonishing array of outfits. And it wasn't just his sartorial extravagance that inspired Mike Myers to create Austin Powers: King even uttered the phrase \"groovy, baby\" in one episode. \"I decided Jason King was going to be an extension of me,\" he once said. \"I was inclined to be a bit of a dandy - I used to go to the tailor with my designs.\" However, he took the character's lifestyle a bit too literally, battling alcoholism in the 1980s. He only quit after cutting ties with a close friend in a fight he couldn't remember. \"Jason King had champagne and strawberries for breakfast, just as I did myself,\" he told The Observer in 1993. \"I drank myself to a standstill. When I think about it now, I'm amazed I'm still here.\" From wartime internment alongside JG Ballard to Klytus.

Born in London in 1920, he started out as a child actor before directing war films including Reach for the Sky and Carve Her Name with Pride. He made his Bond debut with 1967's You Only Live Twice, going on to direct The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. The director's son, John Gilbert, spoke to the BBC and confirmed his father \"died peacefully in his sleep\". Gilbert, who worked together in film with his father added: \"He was a wonderful man with a great sense of humour. He was hard-working and we worked on many films together.\" Gilbert said his father passed away on Friday in Monaco, where he had lived since 1975, after \"suffering from dementia for close to a decade\". Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli paid tribute to the director saying he would be \"sorely missed\". In a statement they said: \"It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of our dear friend Lewis Gilbert.   \"Lewis was a true gentleman.  He made an enormous contribution to the British film industry as well as the Bond films. \"His films are not only loved by us but are considered classics within the series. He will be sorely missed.\" Comedian David Walliams was among those to pay tribute on Twitter to the film-maker \"for all the joy you brought me & millions of others\". Gilbert was Oscar nominated in 1967 for producing Alfie, the film that made Sir Michael Caine a global star. He was made a CBE in 1997 and received a fellowship from the British Film Institute in 2001. Gilbert's other films include Shirley Valentine, which was based, like Educating Rita before it, on a play by Willy Russell. One of his first directing credits was on The Ten Year Plan, a 1945 documentary about the post-war need for prefabricated housing. His last film, 2002's Before You Go, saw him reunite with Dame Julie Walters, who was nominated for an Oscar for Educating Rita. Gilbert's autobiography, All My Flashbacks, was published in 2010.

Her band, along with The Ronettes, were among the definitive girl groups of the 1960s and helped construct Phil Spector's Wall of Sound. Alston sang lead vocals on their first three singles, including the US top 20 hit There's No Other Like My Baby. She died on Friday 16 February after contracting flu, her daughter said. \"She loved The Crystals,\" Donielle Prophete told BBC News. \"She always talked about singing with them, the work they created together. She loved the sisterhood part of it, the travelling.\" The Crystals were originally a quintet consisting of Alston, Dee Dee Kennibrew, Mary Thomas, Patricia Wright and La La Brooks - all of whom grew up singing in the church.  They were put together by big band sideman Benny Wells - who happened to be Alston's uncle - while they were still at school. They were later discovered by Spector while cutting demos for the publisher Hill & Range. Brooks was seen as the lead singer, but Spector disagreed and championed a reluctant Alston instead. \"I just found out recently [that] she had a real problem with being the lead,\" recalled Prophete.  \"They loved her voice and they kept pushing her to the front but she was shy.  \"My sister says mum wanted to do the choreography and stuff like that.\" Nonetheless, Alston's innocent-but-sensuous vocals propelled their first single, There's No Other Like My Baby, into the charts in 1962. It was followed by the dramatic, flamenco-inflected Uptown. However, the band's next single He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss) and its depiction of domestic violence led to a public outcry and Spector eventually pulled the song from sale. Speaking to Mojo magazine in 2010, Brooks recalled that Alston had been \"a little uneasy\" about recording the song and the band were \"taken aback\" by the subject matter. Carole King, who wrote the music to Gerry Goffin's lyrics, subsequently disowned the composition, saying \"it's the one song I kind of wish I hadn't had any part of writing\". After that, Spector took The Crystals name and gave it to his protege Darlene Love, who sang on the band's next two singles, including the hit He's A Rebel (taking The Crystals by surprise when they first heard it on the radio). In 1963, the original quintet were allowed to sing on their own records again and scored their two biggest hits with Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me. By this point, Alston had ceded the limelight to La La Brooks, who took the lead vocal on those and later hits. But Alston remained proud of the band, and stayed involved with their career into her 70s, her daughter said. \"She would always sing around the house, especially around Christmas,\" she recalled. Alston's funeral is being on Friday, with fellow Crystals singer Dee Dee Kennibrew scheduled to be a speaker. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Messick represented McGowan in 1997, when the actress alleged she was raped by Harvey Weinstein - which he denies. McGowan has previously said she was not supported by her management at the time of the alleged attack. Messick's family confirmed she took her own life on Wednesday, adding that she was used as \"collateral damage\" in the Weinstein case. This was after Weinstein's lawyer Ben Brafman published an email from Messick to help deny McGowan's rape claims. The email from Messick acknowledged that an incident had taken place between McGowan and Weinstein, but described it as \"consensual\". Weinstein maintains that McGowan's claim that she was raped by him at the Sundance Festival in 1997 is \"a bold lie\". Messick's family said that she had chosen to stay out of the spotlight in recent months and \"opted not to add to the feeding frenzy, allowing her name and her reputation to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong\". They say she was \"victimised\" during the process and could not cope as she suffered from depression and bipolar disorder. Messick spent five years working at Weinstein's Miramax as an executive between 1997-2003. It was in January 1997 that she first held management responsibilities for McGowan whilst working at Addis Wechsler.  Messick's family said she set up a meeting with McGowan and Weinstein at the Sundance Film Festival as one of her first duties. Her family said in their statement that McGowan told Messick about the alleged assault but did not use the word rape. Messick then went to her bosses at Addis Wechsler to recount the story and her family say this was when a settlement was reached between McGowan and Weinstein. Ten months later, in November, Miramax offered her a production job. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He became a household name when he began presenting Bullseye in 1981. The Sunday tea time show ran for 14 years.

Another favourite phrase - \"keep out of the black and in to the red, nothing in this game for two in a bed\" - referred to the segments of the darts board that the players had to hit. His warm-hearted and quick-witted rapport with the contestants was a big part of the show's appeal.

Richard Harvey, the Colleton County coroner, said the death was \"natural\" and did not otherwise give the cause. Hailing from Brentwood, Long Island, he cut his first single while still a teenager, under the name MC EZ.  After it failed to make an impact, he worked as an assistant to local hip-hop heroes EPMD, acting as a roadie for DJ Scratch and doing various odd jobs. Then he bumped into Sean Combs, then known as Puff Daddy, outside the New York nightclub Mecca, and took the opportunity to rap for him. Suitably impressed, Combs put him on a remix of Mary J Blige's You Don't Have To Worry; and subsequently offered him a recording contract. Bad Boy Records released Mack's laid-back debut album, Project: Funk da World, in 1994. It was propelled into the charts by the success of Flava In Ya Ear - especially the remix, which featured verses from Notorious BIG, LL Cool J and a then-unknown Busta Rhymes.  The single was certified platinum and nominated for a Grammy the following year, while the follow-up single, Get Down, went gold.

The former Supermarket Sweep host died at his home earlier on Wednesday, his long-term agent Jan Kennedy said. Winton spent nearly a decade hosting the ITV daytime hit but also hosted the BBC's lottery show In It To Win It and appeared in game show Hole In The Wall. Graham Norton paid tribute, thanking him for giving him \"the best bit of showbiz advice I ever got - don't quit the hit!\". Friend and fellow TV presenter Davina McCall described him as a \"lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\" Comedian David Walliams said he was \"heartbroken\" to hear of the death of his friend. Winton's agent did not give details on the cause of death but said: \"While we know many will share this terrible loss, we ask that you respect the family's privacy at this time of grief.\" Kate Phillips, controller of entertainment commissioning at the BBC, said Winton was \"an immensely well-loved individual\" and praised his \"wonderfully unique and special energy\" that he brought to TV programmes. \"He was extremely kind, brilliantly funny and was a true gentleman,\" she said. Winton started his career as a DJ in London, leading to work on local radio. In 1986 he joined BBC Bristol to present Pet Watch for BBC One. But his big break came with ITV's daytime show Supermarket Sweep, which he hosted from 1993 to 2001 and again when it was rebooted in 2007. Contestants on the show were tasked with running round a supermarket collecting items to win a cash prize. He went on to work on prime-time shows including the National Lottery's In It To Win It and he hosted his own Christmas specials and celebrity guest shows. More recently Winton, who was known for his tanned appearance, made a show for Channel 5 called Dale Winton's Florida Fly Drive. Channel 5 said the final episodes were due to air in June. In an interview with the Times in 2008, Winton spoke about coming out as gay at the age of 47. He said he had not come out before because no-one had ever asked him. Winton also told the paper that he would stay up every night until the early hours, writing material ahead of his then new BBC show Hole in the Wall. \"I've always been a grafter,\" he said. Winton was born in Marylebone, London in 1955. His mother, Sheree, who was an actress, died from an overdose shortly after his 21st birthday. He told ITV's Loose Women show in 2016 about his struggle with depression and said: \"I always thought, 'Get over yourself.' But my mum died of it. It exists and anybody out there who has had it knows it exists. I didn't want to put one foot in front of the other but for a couple of really good friends.\" One of the friends he named on the show as supporting him was Walliams, with Winton saying \"he has kept me going\". Other friends and celebrity colleagues have paid tribute to the TV star on social media. Singer and friend Boy George  - who appeared on Winton's episode of This is Your Life in 2000 - said he was \"shocked\" to hear of the death and described Winton as \"a sweet man\". Actor and presenter Sherrie Hewson, who worked with Winton \"many times\" said: \"So very sad about the gorgeous Dale Winton... 62 is no age it's hard to believe he's gone.\" Bucks Fizz singer Cheryl Baker, who appeared in a celebrity special of Winton's show The Other Half, said Winton was a \"gorgeous bloke\".  Former Family Fortunes host Les Dennis said Winton was \"a lovely, warm man who posed charm\". TV presenter Paddy McGuinness said: Winton was \"the perfect host\" and made presenting look \"effortless\". RIP Dale Winton, 62. Very sad news.

The Czech-born film-maker, who was 86, was one of a small number of foreign directors to enjoy lasting commercial and critical success in Hollywood. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest starred Jack Nicholson and won five Oscars in 1976, while 1984's Amadeus won eight. Director Edgar Wright was among those paying tribute, saying he \"documented the rebel heart and human spirit\". Very sad to hear that the great director Milo\u0161 Forman has passed away. He had a tremendous filmography that documented the rebel heart and human spirit. I have seen 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' enough times to be able to silently mouth along with the movie. RIP. pic.twitter.com/4QwOHL7tS4 End of Twitter post  by @edgarwright He was \"a great director\" with \"a tremendous filmography\", Wright wrote on Twitter. Forman's other English-language films included 1996's The People vs Larry Flynt, which earned him his third best director Oscar nomination, and 1999's Man on the Moon. Antonio Banderas, who has said he was inspired to become an actor when he watched Forman's 1979 musical Hair, described him as a \"genius of cinematography and master in the portrayal of the human condition\". Farewell to Milo\u0161 Forman, who never made the same film twice, and never made one without interest. Now's a good time to seek out the wonderful TAKING OFF if you've never seen it. End of Twitter post  by @GuyLodge Milos Forman won the Oscar for Best Director twice, and yet he was still one of the most under appreciated filmmakers of the 20th century. RIP Milos, and thanks for the films that will live on for generations to come. End of Twitter post  by @YesitsAlistair Very sad to see that the great Milo\u0161 Forman has died at 86. A brilliant director who made only about a dozen feature films, every one of which is worth revisiting. Hair, Amadeus, Cuckoo's Nest--an indelible legacy. End of Twitter post  by @MarkHarrisNYC Forman was born in Czechoslovakia in 1932 and became an orphan when both his parents were killed in Nazi death camps during World War II. He made his name as a leading figure in Czech new wave cinema in the 1960s, but moved to the US when Russian troops invaded in 1968. His first feature in the US, 1971's Taking Off, was a critical if not commercial success. But the follow-up, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, firmly established him in Hollywood. It was one of the biggest box office hits of 1975, taking more than $100m, and became only the second film in history to win Oscars for best picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay. The film starred Nicholson as a man battling the system in a psychiatric establishment and was based on Ken Kesey's novel. \"To me it was not just literature but real life, the life I lived in Czechoslovakia from my birth in 1932 until 1968,\" Forman once said. \"The Communist Party was my Nurse Ratched, telling me what I could and could not do.\" The director followed that with Hair and 1981's Ragtime before Amadeus, a look at the life of 18th Century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his rival Antonio Salieri. Its Oscars included best picture and best director. After 1989's Valmont, he made The People vs Larry Flynt, with Woody Harrelson cast as the porn publisher. Three years later, Forman cast Jim Carrey to star in Man On The Moon, the biopic of comedian Andy Kaufman.  When Forman was honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the Directors' Guild of America in 2012, the guild's president Taylor Hackford said he \"finds the universality of the human experience in every story\". Forman was married to actresses Jana Brejchova and Vera Kresadlova, having twin boys with the latter. In 1999, he married screenwriter Martina Zborilova, with whom he also had twin sons, Andrew and James - named after Andy Kaufman and Jim Carrey. He died on Friday in the US after a short illness, Martina told Czech news agency CTK. \"His departure was calm and he was surrounded the whole time by his family and his closest friends,\" she said.

He died after a long illness, his daughter said, and would be cremated in a private ceremony. He and his brother Paolo became household names in Italy in the 1960s, and released their latest film in 2017. Internationally, their film Padre Padrone won the Palme D'Or in Cannes in 1977. More recently, docudrama Caesar Must Die won the Golden Bear prize at the Berlin Film Festival in 2012. Vittorio was the elder of the two brothers. They produced their final film together - Rainbow: A Private Affair - last year. While they wrote it together, it was directed solely by 86-year-old Paolo.  Vittorio began studying law at the University of Pisa, but dropped out after becoming interested in cinema. The Taviani brothers wrote and directed short films and produced their first feature in 1962. They continued the partnership - each taking turns to direct alternate scenes with the other watching. The Repubblica newspaper said the two masters of Italian cinema had narrated the history, reality and contradictions of Italy since the 1960s. So close was their partnership that Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni called them individually \"Paolovittorio\". Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
