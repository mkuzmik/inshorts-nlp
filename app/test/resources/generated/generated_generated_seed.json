The move  further strengthens the board as pledged by founder Elon Musk to the Securities and Exchanges Commission. The SEC fined Mr Musk over misleading tweets that he had funding to take Tesla private. Investors greeted the news by sending Tesla shares up more than 4% in morning Friday trading.  Elon Musk remains as chief executive although he agreed with the SEC in October he would step down as chairman.  Larry Ellison is the co-founder and chairman of enterprise cloud software firm Oracle - currently the third largest software maker in the world after Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet.  He already owns three million shares of Tesla stock and is a close friend of Mr Musk.  Actor Robert Downey Jr modelled the character of Tony Stark on Mr Musk for the film Iron Man in 2008, and in 2010, Mr Musk and Mr Ellison famously made cameo appearances in Iron Man 2 as fellow tech billionaires.  Kathleen Wilson-Thompson is the global head of human resources at international pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, and was previously an executive at Kellogg.  The new appointments follow November's move by Tesla to appoint Australian telecoms executive Robyn Denholm as its new chairman. In August, Mr Musk posted a tweet saying that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker off the stock market and make it a private company. He claimed that the funding proposal would value Tesla at $420 per share. Shares in the company briefly rose after his announcement, but later fell again. The SEC said the claim was \"false and misleading\", and decided to sue him for alleged securities fraud. Although he agreed to step down as chairman and pay a $20m (\u00a315m) settlement fine, Mr Musk said recently that he does not respect the SEC. The SEC settlement follows a turbulent year for Tesla and Mr Musk.  In February, Tesla reported a record quarterly loss, partly caused by the carmaker's revamp of its manufacturing process to boost output of the Model 3. The revamp was needed after a surge of orders in 2017 saw it struggling to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers. This prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings. In June, Tesla cut 9% of its workforce as part of a restructuring intended to reduce costs and boost profitability. In October the carmaker reported a quarterly profit for just the third time in its 15-year history. In a striking and emotional interview to the New York Times in August, Mr Musk said he had not been on drugs when he posted the tweets about taking Tesla private. He did however say that he was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks, and that the past year had been the \"most difficult and painful\" of his career.

The Chinese company's chairman has also complained of his firm's \"incredibly unfair treatment\" abroad. In recent weeks, the UK's Defence Secretary and chief of MI6 have been among those to warn that use of Huawei's 5G kit poses risks that need fuller consideration. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and Japan have also flagged concerns. Experts have warned that the Chinese government could compel the company to disrupt telecom networks that use its equipment or spy on their customers. But Huawei denies it would ever do so, noting that such action would undermine its business.  Last week, it invited the media to visit its 5G and cyber-security research labs in Dongguan, Guangdong as part of efforts to counter criticism.  Many of Huawei's clients opt for its products over rivals, such as Nokia and Ericsson, on both cost and technical grounds.  In addition, its smartphones have proven popular with the public.  Huawei recently revealed it had shipped more than 200 million handsets in 2018, placing it second only to Samsung in terms of market share.  \"We are ahead of others in domains like wireless, optical, data communications, and smart devices,\" wrote chairman Guo Ping in a New Year's message shared online. \"For 5G markets that choose to not work with Huawei - they will be like an NBA [National Basketball Association] game without star players: the game will go on, but with less deftness, flair, and expertise.\" Beijing's criticism of the UK was published in the Global Times, an English-language government newspaper. It said Ministry of National Defence spokesman Wu Qian had told a press conference that suggestions the Chinese government might compromise Huawei's technologies were \"groundless\". It said Wu's comment was made in reaction to UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson saying earlier this week that: \"We've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.\" Having made play on a Jane Austen novel title, the newspaper also referenced another popular phrase to offer advice to Huawei, telling it to \"calm down and carry on\" in a separate editorial.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46691846", "content": "A majority stake in Gatwick Airport is to be sold to French operator Vinci Airports for \u00a32.9bn.  Vinci Airports, part of infrastructure group Vinci, will buy 50.01% of the UK's second-busiest airport.  The other 49.99% will be managed by current owners Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). The airport was closed in the run-up to Christmas after reports of drone sightings, in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind. Flights were grounded and about 140,000 passengers affected over three days during the incident. In 2016, Gatwick's expansion plans were dealt a blow when the government rejected its proposal for a new second runway while giving the go-ahead for Heathrow to build a third runway. Gatwick was acquired by a GIP-led consortium in 2009. More than 45 million passengers travel through Gatwick each year, flying to 230 destinations in 70 countries, according to its website. The deal would make Gatwick the largest airport in Vinci's network, which will grow to 46 airports in 12 countries - with a total traffic of about 228 million passengers a year, according to the company. It follows Vinci's takeover of Airports Worldwide's portfolio earlier this year, which included Belfast International and stakes in 12 airports across the US.  Commenting on recent disruption at Gatwick, Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports, said he had \"every confidence\" in the teams currently in place.  \"We will of course work with the airport operational team and the existing shareholders to make Gatwick as resilient as it can be in the face of these new risks,\" he added. Before Christmas, Gatwick was in the public eye for all the wrong reasons. It  was brought to a standstill and around 1,000 flights were cancelled due to apparent drone activity. But the fact remains, London's second airport is potentially a lucrative asset. It handles more than 45 million passengers every year and makes hundreds of millions of pounds in profit.  Vinci says it also offers \"significant potential for growth\". The question is, where will that growth come from? Gatwick is already operating at a high level of efficiency, squeezing the maximum number of landings and takeoffs from its single runway. Its proposal to build a second runway was rejected by the government in 2016. But it has a back-up idea. Earlier this year, it set out a \"masterplan\" for the future - which suggested that an emergency standby runway could be expanded and brought into daily use, to increase capacity. That would certainly be a controversial move - but if it succeeded, there could be major benefits for Vinci. So perhaps the French firm thinks it's worth a gamble. US-based GIP said it expected the transaction to be completed \"by the middle of next year\". The executive team at Gatwick, including chief executive Stewart Wingate, is to be unchanged.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46699288", "content": "US financial markets were mixed on Friday after a choppy trading session that bounced between gains and losses. The Dow Jones index sank 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell about 0.1%, but the Nasdaq gained almost 0.1%. The moves marked a relatively calm end to a wild week of trade, in which US indexes rallied sharply after plunging on Monday. European markets built on those gains on Friday. The FTSE 100 share index closed up more than 2.2% at 6,733.97. In Germany, the DAX gained about 1.7%, while France's CAC index also rose about 1.7%. Many markets have had a dismal year, as investor sentiment soured on fears of decelerating global growth, trade tensions and rising interest rates. Japan's Nikkei suffered its first annual loss in seven years, while Germany's Dax index closed the year down about 18% - the biggest annual loss in a decade. On Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.31% lower at 20,014.77, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed flat, at 25,504.20. In the US, Friday's declines were fairly widespread. However, they spared the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers such as Amazon. Amazon shares jumped more than 1% on Friday, days after the  e-commerce giant told investors it had a \"record-breaking\" holiday season. Analysts cautioned that movements were exacerbated by the lower dealing levels seen during holiday trading. US shares have been hit this week by weaker than expected home sales and consumer confidence data. Concerns about US-China trade tensions also resurfaced, with reports saying US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order banning the use of Chinese technology.

This week we speak to Andy Mooney, chief executive of US guitar company Fender, and formerly a senior executive at both Nike and Disney. Andy Mooney was standing in line at an ice rink in Phoenix, Arizona, when he had a eureka moment that continues to earn entertainment giant Disney more than $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) a year. This was back in 2000, soon after Mr Mooney, a Scot, had been appointed head of Disney's consumer products division. Joining the company after 20 years at Nike, he was working hard to bring himself fully up to speed on every facet of the business. This included going to see a production of Disney on Ice, where figure skaters portray Disney characters. While queuing to get in he noticed that a great many of the young girls - and also their mothers - had dressed up in generic princess dresses, to look like Disney heroines, such as Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. Disney didn't sell such dresses at the time, but Mr Mooney immediately realised that the company was missing an incredibly lucrative trick. \"I was standing in line with mothers and daughters, all dressed head to toe in princess regalia that they had made at home,\" says Mr Mooney, 63. \"I said to a few of the mums 'if Disney made official dresses like this would you buy them?', and they all replied that they'd buy lots. \"So I rushed back to [Disney headquarters] in Burbank [Los Angeles], and we launched the Disney Princess series pretty quickly.\" Not only did Mr Mooney and his team introduce dresses based on those worn by Disney's best-known female characters, they set to work on everything from books to lunchboxes, dolls, magazines, computer games, pyjamas, and tie-ups with food producers. The idea was to start selling basically everything that female Disney fans, both young and old, might like to buy, all featuring one or more Disney princess. \"By the end of 2001 sales across the Disney Princess lines were something like $300m, and today it is more than $6bn a year,\" he says. This is not the success in life that Mr Mooney could have dreamed of when he grew up in a council house in the small Scottish town of Whitburn, half way between Glasgow and Edinburgh. The son of a miner, he left school at 16 to train as an accountant at his local tyre factory. Yet from this modest start, he went on to play a key role in the growth of US footwear and sportswear company Nike. And after his success at Disney, he is now chief executive at Fender, which - for someone who has been an avid guitar player since he was a teenager - is his \"dream job\". After a number of years at the tyre plant Mr Mooney switched to a similarly unglamorous junior accountancy role at the local ironworks. Then aged 25, in 1980, he took his first steps towards to the top of the US corporate world when he applied for, and got, the job as chief finance officer of Nike's UK operation. \"In the interview they didn't ask me anything to do with my accountancy background, it was all about whether I was a cultural fit,\" says Mr Mooney. At the time Nike was primarily selling running shoes, so to best understand the business and his products Mr Mooney says he switched from playing football to jogging. \"I picked up running when I joined, and I have stuck at it ever since, running marathons around the world,\" he says. While Mr Mooney's day job was a financial one, he started to impress his bosses with his gut instinct for what shoes would sell particularly well, and how Nike could best sell more of them.  So much so that Nike UK switched him to head of marketing in 1982. Two years later he was poached by the marketing team at Nike's head office in Oregon, rising to the become chief marketing officer. While at Nike Mr Mooney was a key mover behind the introduction of special limited editions trainers, when inspiration came to him at a set of traffic lights. \"I had become relatively successful, so I could afford to buy a very bad used Porsche 924,\" he says. Then a guy pulled up alongside me in a bright yellow 924, and I went 'what the hell is that?'. I discovered that it was a limited edition version of the car, and I wondered if that would work in shoes... It was a big success.\" After 20 years at Nike Mr Mooney says that Disney approached him, and he left for a fresh challenge in 2000, taking up the head of consumer products role. He stayed with Disney for 11 years before leaving to spend just 26 months as chief executive at sportswear brand Quiksilver, where he admits that for once things didn't work out for him. When he joined Quiksilver it was struggling with debts of more than $1bn. The top position at Fender followed in 2015, which Mr Mooney says really is \"an honour\" for someone who already had a collection of more than 40 guitars. More The Boss features: While he says that Fender's annual turnover is a very respectable $500m, he wants to help increase this by reducing the number of people who give up on trying to learn to play their guitar. \"The industry has a retention problem,\" he says. \"Some 45% of guitars we sell go to first time buyers, half of whom are women, but 90% of all new players then abandon the instrument in the first year.\" To help more people learn how to play their guitar (and then potentially buy another), Fender launched \"Fender Play\" last year, online guitar tutorials that are now used by 70,000 people. Mark Ritson, adjunct professor of marketing at Melbourne Business School, says: \"Andy Mooney is an unusual chief executive. \"He has a strong marketing background, and has proven adept at first understanding the customers his businesses were targeting, and then using that knowledge to diversify and grow revenues. \"His role at Fender will be to do that again. The fact that he plays a mean guitar does him no harm either.\" When not busy at work Mr Mooney now jams with some of his guitar heroes, such as Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine, and Jim Root of Slipknot. And he has swapped Scotland for Los Angeles' exclusive Hollywood Hills. \"I do have to pinch myself,\" he says.", "label": "business"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46546014", "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world.

Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus all had their troubles but managed to escape the year without seeing their brands trashed in quite the same way as their parent. So, it's no surprise to see articles related to Facebook's various scandals secured it three of the spots in BBC Tech's most-read stories list for 2018. Two other controversy magnets - Elon Musk and Huawei - however, narrowly missed out.  And for the first time since we started compiling this list in 2012, none of the placings went to a product launch. Below are the most clicked on articles for each month of the year - a mix of controversy, endeavour and sparkly revenge. January: Chipocalypse Now Software flaws have long been a bane of computing, but when news emerged of serious vulnerabilities in popular processor chips there was a serious intake of breath from the cyber-security community. Billions of PCs, smartphones and other devices were said to be susceptible to the Meltdown and Spectre bugs - including, as it emerged, Apple's products. At one point there was talk of owners having to brace themselves for their machines feeling noticeably more sluggish as a result of the workarounds that would be needed, or even needing to send their computers in for component swap-outs. A year on, there doesn't appear to have been any malware related to the flaws reported in the wild, even though further variants of the originally disclosed exploits have been discovered.  And as far as personal computers are concerned, the patches released don't appear to have caused much of a hit to performance. February: Fake porn Deepfakes gave the internet something else to worry about in February, after it emerged that free software meant anyone could replace the face of one person with another's in video footage so long as you had enough photos of the latter. Inevitably, the tool was used to create pornography with a range of predominantly young female celebrities' features generated to supplant those of the original adult actresses. One after another websites lined up to ban the content until Reddit, which had been home to much of it, decided to do likewise. As the algorithms involved have improved, there has been much discussion about the danger of fake news creators adopting the face-mapping technique  to create bogus videos of politicians. But there's another worrying trend.  It appears that some Deepfakers are attempting to scrape social media for images of acquaintances that they can turn into pornography, and have been sharing details of their progress in chat forums. March: Cambridge Analytica Donald Trump's election in 2016 helped put Cambridge Analytica in the public eye after reports that its psychological profiles of US voters had helped his campaign target messages. But the London-based consultancy only became a household name after a report in the Observer explained how the firm had made use of millions of harvested Facebook accounts' details, while a follow-up Channel 4 TV report recorded the consultancy's chief on tape discussing how beautiful girls could be sent to a politician's house  as a honey-trap. Facebook also found itself in the firing line. It didn't help itself by first trying to suppress the story and then quibbling over whether it warranted being described as a \"data breach\". Yesterday @facebook threatened to sue us. Today we publish this. Meet the whistleblower blowing the lid off Facebook & Cambridge Analytica. https://t.co/QcuBJfBU5T End of Twitter post  by @carolecadwalla When Mark Zuckerberg did finally apologise several days later, he made a promise that has been repeatedly thrown back at him since. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he said. April: Scandal grows By early April, Facebook was estimating that up to 87 million of its members' details had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. More than a million of them were thought to belong to UK-based users.  This was based on the number of accounts that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - had harvested from the social network via a personality quiz. Soon after, Cambridge Analytica responded that its parent, SCL Elections, had in fact \"only\" licensed 30 million people's records from Dr Kogan, and all, it said, had been from US citizens. That wasn't enough to save it - the political consultancy folded in May. But it now forms part of Facebook's defence against a fine from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which was imposed despite the watchdog acknowledging that it had found no evidence that UK citizens' data had been passed to Cambridge Analytica. The \u00a3500,000 amount is peanuts to the social network - it makes more in half an hour, and the reputational damage it has incurred has arguably been far more costly. But Facebook is concerned that the penalty could set a precedent for other data regulators to follow. May: RIP TotalBiscuit The British video games critic John \"TotalBiscuit\" Bain had first told his fans and wider following that he had cancer in 2015. By April 2018 the 33-year-old had announced he was retiring from journalism as the medication he was on was preventing him from thinking clearly. Even so, his death shocked and saddened many of his 2.2 million YouTube fans when it was confirmed. The obituaries that followed mostly focused on how he had championed indie games and criticised some of their bigger-budgeted rivals, which he had said sometimes prioritised profit over all else.  But on social media and in some later articles, there was criticism of the role Mr Bain had played in the GamerGate movement. It was claimed he had given legitimacy to a misogynistic campaign that had been responsible for the harassment of others.  But this in turn spurred on his supporters to defend his legacy. They said his involvement had been mischaracterised and noted that Mr Bain had called for ethics in games journalism for several years before GamerGate existed. June: Data from the deep The phrase \"the cloud\" conjures up images of our data being stored in some nebulous form high above us. In reality, tech firms are investing billions of pounds in racks of computer servers housed in gigantic data centres across the globe to power the apps we use and internet services we call on. For the most part, these are built at ground-level. But in June, Microsoft sank an experimental data centre into the sea off Orkney in the north of Scotland. The idea is to reduce cooling costs by keeping the equipment in a sealed vault underwater. The tech giant intends to monitor Project Natick for five years to see if the scheme is a practical proposition for a wider rollout. But elsewhere, Google revealed it had already made the switch to liquid-cooling to tackle the heat given off by its latest artificial intelligence-focused computer servers. But rather than dropping its equipment overboard, it is piping coolant to each chip. July: Thoughtless threat PayPal was guilty of a major faux pas when it wrote to Lindsay Durdle, one of its recently deceased customers, to say her death was a breach of its rules. To make matters worse, it added that it might take legal action as a consequence. Her husband Howard Durdle was appalled, and to be fair so was PayPal's PR team when the BBC brought the matter to its attention. Although the firm was unable to confirm exactly what had gone wrong it attempted to make good on the situation by writing off a debt his wife had owed. \"PayPal have been in touch, have apologised sincerely and have promised to change whatever they need to internally to ensure this can't happen again,\" Mr Durdle tweeted after the BBC's article was published. \"I just hope more organisations can apply empathy and common sense to avoid hurting the recently bereaved.\" August: Mystery satellite As official statements go, the US State Department's wasn't the most reassuring: \"We don't know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it.\" The subject was a Russian satellite that had been launched 10 months earlier and was displaying abnormal behaviour.  One US official suggested it could be a space weapon designed to destroy other satellites - an allegation a Russian diplomat slammed as being \"unfounded [and] slanderous\". For those who track such developments, the US's suspicions echoed those raised about another Russian launch four years earlier when what was thought to be a bit of debris started zipping about in orbit. In any case, at the end of the year we are officially none the wiser about the objects true capabilities.  But with the Trump administration pursuing its own plan to create a Space Force by 2020, off-planet militarisation looks set to remain a hot topic. September: Facebook flaw With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still ratting along, Facebook revealed that a separate problem had exposed almost 50 million accounts to being hijacked. The cause was a vulnerability in the code of its View As privacy facility, which was designed to let users see what their profile looked like to others. At the time, Facebook said it was \"temporarily turning off\" the tool while it conducted a review. Three months on, it remains disabled. The firm did, however, revise its estimate down to 30 million accounts. While we're on the topic, here's some of Facebook's other controversies in 2018: In an end of year message posted yesterday, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had become much more \"proactive\" at addressing the challenges it faced but warned some problems could \"never be fully solved\". But overall, he said he was \"proud of the progress\" Facebook had made in 2018. October: Power struggle Many of us have experienced the sinking feeling that comes from leaving the home in the morning to discover your smartphone battery never recharged overnight. Typically, it's a case of failing to properly plug the handset in. But a YouTuber's tests of the latest iPhones indicated some of the new devices only topped up their power if their displays were \"woken up\" first.  Inevitably this was dubbed \"chargegate\",  and when the BBC published its take on the issue Apple had yet to comment. But a week later, when it released the next version of its mobile operating system, Apple's accompanying notes confirmed it had fixed a bug that had caused the flaw. November: #Dontbeevil At the start of the year the Time's Up movement was founded to take a stand against sexual assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace. It was a response to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein but also marked an effort to tackle problems faced by women more widely. Eleven months later, seven of Google's employees declared \"time's up\" on the tech giant after accusations of misconduct emerged involving two past male high-fliers as well as dozens of other staff. As a result, workers at Google's offices across the world staged a series of walkouts. Managers were delivered a set of demands, including a call to end the firm's requirement that sexual harassment disputes be dealt with internally. About a week later, Google's chief Sundar Pichai confirmed that the business would indeed stop its policy of forced arbitration, opening the door to it being sued over the matter in the future. December: Glitter bomb The internet fell in love with a revenge prank staged by an ex-Nasa engineer earlier this month. After having a package stolen from his porch, Mark Rober constructed a \"bomb\" that married a centrifugal motor, lots of glitter, fart spray and several smartphones. He then hid the device within an Apple Homepod speaker box and left it on his porch. When thieves subsequently stole it, it recorded the moment it sprayed them with its contents. After which, Mr Rober retrieved the package and repeated the exercise. In an ideal world, the story would have ended there, with Mr Rober's YouTube fame assured thanks to the compilation video he made. But a couple of days after uploading the footage,  the inventor replaced the video with a shorter edit. Some viewers had voiced suspicions about parts of the footage, and Mr Rober acknowledged that when he had chased up their concerns he had discovered that one of his helpers had recruited acquaintances to pose as two of the five featured thieves. An important note: pic.twitter.com/9MgQFVbhoB End of Twitter post  by @MarkRober \"I'm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn't just taint the entire effort as 'fake',\" he tweeted. Most viewers seem to have been forgiving, but it's unfortunate that what was a fun stunt might cause many to be more suspicious and cynical about what they see online in the future.

Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus all had their troubles but managed to escape the year without seeing their brands trashed in quite the same way as their parent. So, it's no surprise to see articles related to Facebook's various scandals secured it three of the spots in BBC Tech's most-read stories list for 2018. Two other controversy magnets - Elon Musk and Huawei - however, narrowly missed out.  And for the first time since we started compiling this list in 2012, none of the placings went to a product launch. Below are the most clicked on articles for each month of the year - a mix of controversy, endeavour and sparkly revenge. January: Chipocalypse Now Software flaws have long been a bane of computing, but when news emerged of serious vulnerabilities in popular processor chips there was a serious intake of breath from the cyber-security community. Billions of PCs, smartphones and other devices were said to be susceptible to the Meltdown and Spectre bugs - including, as it emerged, Apple's products. At one point there was talk of owners having to brace themselves for their machines feeling noticeably more sluggish as a result of the workarounds that would be needed, or even needing to send their computers in for component swap-outs. A year on, there doesn't appear to have been any malware related to the flaws reported in the wild, even though further variants of the originally disclosed exploits have been discovered.  And as far as personal computers are concerned, the patches released don't appear to have caused much of a hit to performance. February: Fake porn Deepfakes gave the internet something else to worry about in February, after it emerged that free software meant anyone could replace the face of one person with another's in video footage so long as you had enough photos of the latter. Inevitably, the tool was used to create pornography with a range of predominantly young female celebrities' features generated to supplant those of the original adult actresses. One after another websites lined up to ban the content until Reddit, which had been home to much of it, decided to do likewise. As the algorithms involved have improved, there has been much discussion about the danger of fake news creators adopting the face-mapping technique  to create bogus videos of politicians. But there's another worrying trend.  It appears that some Deepfakers are attempting to scrape social media for images of acquaintances that they can turn into pornography, and have been sharing details of their progress in chat forums. March: Cambridge Analytica Donald Trump's election in 2016 helped put Cambridge Analytica in the public eye after reports that its psychological profiles of US voters had helped his campaign target messages. But the London-based consultancy only became a household name after a report in the Observer explained how the firm had made use of millions of harvested Facebook accounts' details, while a follow-up Channel 4 TV report recorded the consultancy's chief on tape discussing how beautiful girls could be sent to a politician's house  as a honey-trap. Facebook also found itself in the firing line. It didn't help itself by first trying to suppress the story and then quibbling over whether it warranted being described as a \"data breach\". Yesterday @facebook threatened to sue us. Today we publish this. Meet the whistleblower blowing the lid off Facebook & Cambridge Analytica. https://t.co/QcuBJfBU5T End of Twitter post  by @carolecadwalla When Mark Zuckerberg did finally apologise several days later, he made a promise that has been repeatedly thrown back at him since. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he said. April: Scandal grows By early April, Facebook was estimating that up to 87 million of its members' details had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. More than a million of them were thought to belong to UK-based users.  This was based on the number of accounts that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - had harvested from the social network via a personality quiz. Soon after, Cambridge Analytica responded that its parent, SCL Elections, had in fact \"only\" licensed 30 million people's records from Dr Kogan, and all, it said, had been from US citizens. That wasn't enough to save it - the political consultancy folded in May. But it now forms part of Facebook's defence against a fine from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which was imposed despite the watchdog acknowledging that it had found no evidence that UK citizens' data had been passed to Cambridge Analytica. The \u00a3500,000 amount is peanuts to the social network - it makes more in half an hour, and the reputational damage it has incurred has arguably been far more costly. But Facebook is concerned that the penalty could set a precedent for other data regulators to follow. May: RIP TotalBiscuit The British video games critic John \"TotalBiscuit\" Bain had first told his fans and wider following that he had cancer in 2015. By April 2018 the 33-year-old had announced he was retiring from journalism as the medication he was on was preventing him from thinking clearly. Even so, his death shocked and saddened many of his 2.2 million YouTube fans when it was confirmed. The obituaries that followed mostly focused on how he had championed indie games and criticised some of their bigger-budgeted rivals, which he had said sometimes prioritised profit over all else.  But on social media and in some later articles, there was criticism of the role Mr Bain had played in the GamerGate movement. It was claimed he had given legitimacy to a misogynistic campaign that had been responsible for the harassment of others.  But this in turn spurred on his supporters to defend his legacy.

District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, said the Washington Post.  It accused Facebook of allowing the wholesale scraping of personal data on tens of millions of users.  The action adds to a number of regulatory investigations, following a year of privacy and security missteps.  A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: \"We're reviewing the complaint and look forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in DC and elsewhere.\"  As well as this lawsuit, Facebook is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.  In the UK, the company was fined \u00a3500,000 over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the maximum fine the British data regulator could impose. Bigger trouble may arise from the Irish data protection regulator, which is investigating Facebook for multiple admissions of security flaws, in what is being seen as the first major test of Europe\u2019s new privacy rules as dictated by the General Data Protection Regulation.  According to the Post, the DC attorney general\u2019s action could be amended to include more recent data security admissions, including more revelations published on Wednesday by the New York Times.

But this popularity is fairly recent. Why have podcasts taken so long to become visible, and does that mean you can make a living out of them? It's easy to make a podcast.   All you need is something you want to say, a microphone, a recording device (known as a tape recorder in the old days) and some editing software.   For enthusiasts, part of the beauty of audio has always been that you don't have to be a technological wizard to create something magical. While podcasts have been around for a good decade and a half, they've emerged from their niche recently thanks to the proliferation of smartphones, podcast apps and voice-activated speakers in homes. Plus, their more informal, less \"produced\" style is proving popular with the much sought-after \"millennial\" generation, says Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism in New York. \"What podcasting has is a youth audience that feels very passionately about the people that they listen to and that they engage with.\" And the old problem of visibility has largely been solved by distribution platforms from the likes of Apple, SoundCloud and Whooshkaa, although it's still true that old fashioned word-of-mouth is one of the most effective ways of getting your podcast noticed. Now there are more than 600,000 shows worldwide covering everything from sport, politics and music, to the thoughts of geeks in their bedrooms. The podcast has become fashionable. And not just in the West. South Korea tops the global rankings, according to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2018, with 58% of its population listening to a news podcast in the past month, compared with 33% in the US and 18% in the UK. Young people are now far more likely to listen to podcasts than to speech radio, Reuters says. \"What distinguishes radio from TV is the intimacy. What distinguishes a podcast from radio is that it's intimacy plus, because you've chosen it and it's literally in your ears,\" explains Olly Mann, who's been co-hosting Answer me This since 2007 with comedian Helen Zaltzman, and now also produces The Modern Mann. \"People tend to listen on headphones in their personal bubble.\" He describes the growth in podcasts as a \"slow, gentle upward curve\", but like others, acknowledges that there is one show responsible for propelling the genre into the mainstream: Serial.  In October 2014, the team behind the successful public radio programme This American Life released the first episodes of their true crime story set in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Serial broke the mould because it was a podcast first, not just a radio show uploaded to the internet after broadcast, as was typical at the time. Producer Julie Snyder says this meant that if the show flopped, they hadn't wasted too much time, money or reputation. But listeners were gripped by reporter Sarah Koenig's investigation into the murder of high school student Hae Min Lee and the conviction and imprisonment of her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed.  Now in its third season, Serial has been downloaded 420 million times in total. And it's testament to the influence of Season One that Syed has been granted a retrial.  Source: Wired, Global, Vulture Lists \"A lot of people were not used to hearing non-fiction serialised storytelling that's as compelling as Serial was,\" says Ms Snyder. \"And because the technological barriers had sort of come down, it was really easy to get at. For the first time a lot of people learned how to access a podcast.\"  Its success encouraged many listeners to explore what else was out there, she believes. But how do you make money from podcasting? Here's where it gets a little complicated. Once you've pressed Save on your programme, you need a hosting platform to which you can drag and drop your show.  That platform creates an RSS (\"rich site summary\" or \"really simple syndication\") feed - the link between your audio file and the so-called pod catchers - programs that download and distribute the podcasts to your listening device. \"It's a very fragmented marketplace,\" says Ross Adams, chief executive of Acast, the Stockholm-based podcasting platform that hosts 3,500 podcasters.   Acast not only looks after the technical nuts and bolts, but also the advertising that gives podcasters a chance to monetise their content.  In common with other digital platforms, Acast's global sales teams sells advertising on a \"cost per mille\" (CPM) basis.  So if your podcast has 1,000 listeners and there are six ad slots, that adds up to a total of 6,000 impressions, or clicks, to sell. But podcast advertising doesn't come cheap. Airtime ads start at about \u00a312 ($15) CPM, but some branded content may sell for as much as \u00a3100 ($126) CPM, says Mr Adams. More Technology of Business \"It's the most expensive priced audio product in the marketplace,\" says Mr Adams, largely because podcast audiences tend to be affluent and audio ads are effective, particularly if they're read out by the programme host.  \"It's not a commercial radio audience that's listening, it's the Netflix subscriber, the Spotify premium subscriber,\" he says. \"It's the very affluent audiences, which is why we can charge a lot higher.\" This sounds like good news for the impoverished podcaster, but bear in mind that as far as spending on digital advertising goes, audio is still the poor relation to video, where revenue is measured in billions, rather than hundreds of millions.  Nevertheless, a report for the Interactive Advertising Bureau by consultants PWC predicts advertising revenues in the US digital audio sector will grow more than 110% to $659m (\u00a3521m) by 2020. It's that sort of upward trend that has convinced industry heavyweights like the UK radio company Global to launch a podcasting service on its global player app. Networks like Radiotopia and Gimlet Media, and platforms and apps like Acast and Global, help make the podcast visible to listeners and advertisers, and because they aggregate podcasters, even those with lower download figures stand a chance of attracting advertising. That said, the marketplace is still too crowded for many people to make serious money.   \"For anybody who wants to make a living on it there's nowhere near enough money,\" says Emily Bell. \"I'm sure probably over 80% of the revenue goes to the top 20% of the podcasts.\"  But audio has never been all about the money.

He looks at a pitch and he doesn't think it's a hard toil, he thinks wickets, he thinks 'how can I get a breakthrough for the team'. \"What I've seen in the last 12 months is the way he has matured in Test cricket and the way that he is bowling so soon, so quickly in his Test career, I think is a very scary sign for all the batsmen around the world. \"I mean, in Test cricket if there is a pitch like Perth, I wouldn't want to face Jasprit Bumrah, to be honest, because once he's on a roll he can really crank it up.\" India bounced back after losing the second Test in Perth to declare twice at the MCG, with their bowlers tearing Tim Paine's side apart for 151 and 261. The defeat in Melbourne came in Paine's sixth Test match as Australia captain after replacing Steve Smith, who was banned along with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft for ball-tampering during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March. Smith and Warner's year-long suspensions will expire in late March 2019, and Paine admitted Australia missed their presence following a poor batting performance. \"I think it's inexperience, it's pressure, India's bowling attack is probably as good as most of us have ever played,\" he said. \"I think it's pretty clear that if you take two or three of the best players out of anyone's line-up around the world, you're going to struggle a little bit at times and you are going to have inconsistent performances. \"The silver lining is that we do have world-class players that are available soon to come back into this side, and clearly when they do they will make a huge difference.\" With several players under pressure for their place, the Aussies have added all-rounder Marnus Labuschagne to their squad for the final Test.

The clock can be turned back to Steven Gerrard's catastrophic slip as Liverpool lost at home to Chelsea in 2014, a defeat that opened the door for Manchester City to rip the crown from their grasp. And there was the outstanding campaign under Rafael Benitez in 2008-09 when Liverpool lost only two league games out of 38 but still ended up in second place, four points behind champions Manchester United. This time, however, feels different.  This season feels like the opening Liverpool have waited almost 29 years for - created by manager Jurgen Klopp's potent blend of expensively assembled defensive solidity, in the shape of \u00a375m defender Virgil van Dijk and \u00a367m goalkeeper Alisson, and ferociously threatening attack. Liverpool's stars are aligned and even though Klopp and his players - Dejan Lovren's recent mention of an unbeaten season apart - will never tempt fate, they will be acutely aware of the opportunity they now have. Klopp's side are nine points clear of Tottenham after the north Londoners' shock home defeat by Wolves and 10 ahead of Manchester City, who visit Southampton on Sunday. They are unbeaten after 20 Premier League games and every key player in the team, and indeed the team as a whole, is hitting a peak. Yes, they could almost touch the finishing line in 2014, but they were under pressure with City right on their shoulder. This feels like a Liverpool team in control of the Premier League and its own destiny. Liverpool and Klopp will know the acid test is approaching when they visit Etihad Stadium on 3 January - but what riches they have in the bank with the knowledge that, at worst, they will start that game with a seven-point advantage over Pep Guardiola's reigning champions. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The suggestion that their unbeaten run has somehow broken Manchester City's resolve, worn them down, is a nonsense - and disrespectful to the quality of players and characters Guardiola has assembled. What is beyond question, however, is that Liverpool have taken control of this Premier League title race with a verve and momentum that currently looks like it will take some stopping. The fans can sense it too.  Anfield has had false dawns before, but Liverpool and Klopp gained the total trust of their supporters in that thrilling run to the Champions League final last season. And they have simply carried on where they left off, aided by key additions such as Alisson, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri. Supporters swarmed around the team bus on its arrival for the Arsenal game and a huge roar swept around the stadium once the immediate shock of Ainsley Maitland-Niles giving Arsenal the lead had dissipated. Liverpool were asked the question and the answer could not have been more emphatic. Nerves? Pressure? Not here as, led by Roberto Firmino's hat-trick, they gathered themselves in seconds and simply blitzed Arsenal. And whereas the ill-fated 2014 title run was an adrenalin-fuelled thrill ride from the turn of the year, led by Luis Suarez's brilliance and characterised by Gerrard's emotional \"this does not slip\" speech in a huddle of Liverpool's players after a win against Manchester City put the title in sight, this feels controlled, relaxed, even ruthless. Liverpool had Suarez, Daniel Sturridge in prime form and the tyro Raheem Sterling doing the damage back then while it is Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah now. There is, however, one decisive difference. Liverpool have only conceded eight goals in their first 20 league games. In 2013-14, they shipped 50. They are currently 31 league games unbeaten at Anfield and have conceded only 13 goals in that time. Salah felt confident enough, and the entire team comfortable enough at 4-1, to allow Firmino to take over penalty duties to complete his hat-trick, while a volley from Jordan Henderson that set sail in the direction of Liverpool city centre was greeted with a colourful response from The Kop, which the captain acknowledged with a beaming smile and arms raised aloft. Klopp will do his best to keep the lid on title talk but Liverpool's performances, and the manner in which opponents are now being devastated in similar fashion to last term, makes the task increasingly difficult. Liverpool are now Premier League title favourites. No debate. The door is open and if Manchester City do not wrest something from them on Thursday, then 2019 can be the year the great drought, the era in which they lost their status as the great domestic superpower, can be ended.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/46714834", "content": "Cameron Bancroft made only two on his return from a nine-month ban for ball-tampering as Perth Scorchers lost to Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash. The 26-year-old Australia batsman, whose ban ended on Saturday, lasted only three deliveries in the Scorchers' 107-8 in Launceston. Bancroft was caught using sandpaper to alter the condition of the ball against South Africa in Cape Town in March. The Hurricanes chased 108 to win by six wickets with 15 balls to spare. A fourth successive victory extended their lead at the top of the table to four points. Bancroft, who came in at number five with the Scorchers 16-3, collected two to square leg off the first ball he faced. He defended his next delivery before edging Riley Meredith behind as he attempted to force off the back foot. Meredith finished with 3-15, while Jofra Archer, who will qualify for England in 2019, returned figures of 0-26 and England's David Willey made six off 13 balls. Bancroft, keeping wicket, took a smart, diving catch and another regulation one in the Hurricanes' largely comfortable chase. Bancroft has played club cricket since being banned along with Australia captain Steve Smith and David Warner, whose year-long suspensions end in late March 2019.

The year began with an Ashes drubbing for England, featured a fairytale summer farewell and ended with Virat Kohli arguing with someone. Again. Oh, and some Australians got banned for cheating along the way. BBC Sport hands out the prizes after a tumultuous year in the cricket world. Surely you don't need to ask? Already India captain, totem and icon, Virat Kohli proved this year he is unquestionably the best player in the world. If his returns in Test cricket were impressive - 1,322 at an average of 55 - his one-day international haul of 1,202 at 134 bordered on ludicrous. He arrived in England this summer with question marks over his claims to greatness. He responded by averaging 59 in a series when most batsmen survived as long as an ice cube on a warm day. Despite defeat in England, Kohli led India to a first Test win in Australia in 10 years - and they will begin 2019 as they did 2018, as officially the best side in the world. If New Zealand had played more than six Tests, Kane Williamson - with an average of 67 - might have run Kohli close, while Alyssa Healy won a staggering four player-of-the-match awards in six games as Australia women romped to the Women's World Twenty20 title. Alastair Cook and James Anderson can accept this award on behalf of their scriptwriter, who delivered an end to the summer so joyful that it made the Shawshank Redemption finale look positively miserable. From the moment Cook, the holder of almost every England Test batting record there is, announced the final Test against India would be his last, you sensed it might be emotional. Walking out to bat, taking guard, maybe even adjusting his box - Cook was given countless standing ovations before he sent the Oval crowd into a frenzy with a fairytale farewell century in his final innings. Anderson supplied the encore the following day with his 564th Test wicket, taking him past Australia great Glenn McGrath as the most successful pace bowler of all time and wrapping up a 4-1 series win. Cook called Anderson the greatest player of all time. Anderson said the same about Cook. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. Cameron Bancroft, take a bow. The Australia batsman wins this from a field of one, although he might ask Steve Smith and David Warner to accompany him to the awards ceremony. Bancroft was caught during the Cape Town Test against South Africa trying to scuff up the ball using sandpaper - which he then tried to hide down his trousers. All in full view of the television cameras. Bancroft was banned for nine months, while captain Smith and vice-captain Warner - both of whom admitted knowing about the plan - got a year apiece. Sympathy was in short supply. The Australian and British prime ministers put the boot in, and Smith and Warner blubbed like three-year-olds in news conferences broadcast around the world. Coach Darren Lehmann said he didn't know about the sandpaper plan and wouldn't resign. Then he did. Needless to say, there were tears there too. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Australia fans, look away again. A couple of hefty defeats on that ill-fated tour of South Africa were contenders for this prize - Australia lost the third Test by 322 runs and the fourth by 492 - and they were crushed by 373 runs by Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. But the biggest thumping of the year was dished out by England, who won the third one-day international against Australia by 242 runs. The hosts smashed the ODI record in making a scarcely believable 481-6 at Trent Bridge. Alex Hales battered 147 off 92 balls, Jonny Bairstow 139 off 92. Australia were bowled out for 237, with 13 overs unused. There must have been a temptation for England to let them have another go. It was Australia's heaviest one-day defeat in terms of runs. They lost the series 5-0. The flight home could not come soon enough. Bangladesh gave it their best shot when they were bowled out for 43 by West Indies, while South Africa laid claim to the award in being skittled for 73 in 29 overs in Sri Lanka.  Pakistan losing their last seven wickets for 41 runs as they contrived to lose the first Test by four runs against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi was mightily impressive in its own way. However, at a time when England seem intent on bringing the collapse back into fashion, it simply had to be Joe Root's side who collected this gong. Playing their first Test since being thumped 4-0 in the Ashes, England folded like a cheap deckchair against New Zealand as they were bowled out for 58 in the face of some admittedly excellent swing bowling from Trent Boult and Tim Southee. It was their sixth lowest total in Test history. The innings barely lasted 20 overs. Five batsmen made ducks. Only two reached double figures. One saving grace for England was that, from 27-9, it could have been even worse. A tough one, mainly because there has been plenty of anger on and off the cricket pitch this year. It began with CCTV footage of Australia's David Warner and South Africa's Quinton de Kock being separated by team-mates in the stairwell outside the changing rooms in Durban. It continued with a pumped-up Kagiso Rabada shoulder-barging Steve Smith in the very next Test in Port Elizabeth. Confrontation is like oxygen to the scowling India skipper Virat Kohli, although his 'mic drop' impersonation in an attempt to rile Joe Root at Edgbaston proved fruitless. The award, though, goes to England's Jonny Bairstow, who 'celebrated' his century against Sri Lanka on his return to the side by ripping off his helmet, dropping his bat and letting out a roar that would not have been out of place in WWE. That he was miffed at what he perceived as criticism from the media made it all the more remarkable. Anyone who can have an argument in an empty room deserves to win this prize. Amelia Kerr smashed a women's record 232 not out off 145 balls for New Zealand in an ODI in Ireland. Then she took 5-17. Best of all, she was only 17 at the time. Australia seamer Andrew Tye, who conceded an eye-watering 0-100 from nine overs in England's ODI-record 481 at Trent Bridge.  Glenn Maxwell's remarkable effort to remove Faf du Plessis, leaping to catch the ball at long-on, throwing it up in mid-air while over the boundary, jumping back inside the rope and completing the catch on the run. In an age when exceptional catches have almost become the norm, this was still something else. Remember Mason Crane? The leg-spinner took 1-193 in the final Ashes Test in Sydney, the most expensive figures by an England debutant. A back injury forced him home from the New Zealand tour that followed, then ended his county season in June. Joe Denly. Aged 32 and out of the England side for more than eight years, the Kent all-rounder was recalled for the winter tour to Sri Lanka. In his first game back, he only went and won the man-of-the-match award, with 20 off 17 balls and 4-19 opening the bowling with his leg-spin. David Warner, one of cricket's most notorious sledgers, walked off the field mid-innings during a Sydney grade match after receiving a few choice words from Jason Hughes, the brother of the late Phillip Hughes. While what was said remains a mystery, the irony was not lost on anyone. With all due respect to the record-breaking Alastair Cook and the cuddly old-timer Rangana Herath, AB de Villiers is a clear winner of this award. An entertainer, innovator and all-round good egg, he scored more than 20,000 runs for South Africa in all forms of the game. None of them could be described as ugly. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         Can you name the bowler with the best Test figures of 2018? Didn't think so. It's time to doff your cap to South Africa left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took 9-129 against Sri Lanka in July. South Africa still lost by 199 runs. Congratulations to the Joyces. Ed, the former England batsman, called time on a distinguished 21-year career after playing in Ireland's inaugural Test in May, and his sisters Isobel and Cecelia followed suit when Ireland bowed out of the Women's World Twenty20 in November. Surrey may not be the most popular team in county cricket, but not even their harshest critics could fail to be impressed by the manner in which they dominated the County Championship this summer. They won a first title for 16 years with two games to spare - and did it thanks to 13 home-grown or academy players. An award you didn't expect to be reading about, but the England and Wales Cricket Board's decision to reduce the residency qualification rules for overseas-born players from seven years to three means we could all enjoy the supremely talented Jofra Archer - born and raised in the West Indies, now playing for Sussex - wearing an England shirt in the not-too-distant future.

Spurs led through Harry Kane's spectacular 25-yard strike in the first half but Wolves punished a poor second-half performance, scoring three times in the final 18 minutes to end their hosts' five-game winning run. The north London side would have moved only three points behind leaders Liverpool with a win, but the defeat and the Reds' 5-1 win over Arsenal means the Merseyside club ended the day nine points clear. \"We have had a very good run in the last few weeks and to keep that level is difficult,\" said Pochettino, whose side won 6-2 and 5-0 against Everton and Bournemouth respectively in their last two games. \"We tried to play a little more in the second half, but we were too direct and I think we started to pay for the effort in the other games.  \"We are not machines. We need to understand that we cannot get ourselves in this situation.\" Willy Boly brought the visitors level with a powerful header in the 72nd minute and Raul Jimenez then beat Hugo Lloris with a weak effort from the edge of the area to put Wolves in front. Helder Costa added a third on the counter-attack three minutes from time. Spurs, who did not have a single shot in the second half, remain second in the table but Manchester City can go back above them when they visit Southampton on Sunday. Spurs' performance in the second half was in a stark contrast to their previous two games, when they scored 11 goals. That free-scoring form had led manager Pochettino to admit his side were \"intruders\" in the title race, but a fifth league defeat of the season halts the momentum they had built. The north London side played well in the first half and had 10 efforts on goal, though most - including Kane's goal - came from distance. Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min were particularly lively. But after the break they were flat and lacked cohesion, the influence of Kane, Son and Eriksen diminished, and the introduction of Lucas Moura failed to spark them into life. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The tension inside Wembley increased as the home support witnessed their team lose control of the game as Wolves, who had barely threatened in the first half, grew in confidence. After Boly's deserved equaliser, the Spurs fans tried to squeeze more from their team but it was Wolves, helped by some slack defending, who created all of the chances late on. \"We did not dominate the ball in the second half,\" Pochettino said.  \"We were wrong in the way we tried to play, too much long ball and our energy dropped in the second half.\" Wolves' fans, players and manager Nuno Espirito Santo celebrated wildly at full-time. They did not create chances in the opening 45 minutes but, unlike Everton and Bournemouth before them, defended well enough to stay in the game. Then, when Spurs' performance dipped, they began to exert control on the game and Nuno made the right substitutions. Joao Moutinho was introduced to the base of midfield in the 68th minute and dictated play, as well as providing the pin-point cross from the set-piece for Boly's equaliser. Striker Costa, meanwhile, came on in the 59th minute and made an excellent run before a clinical low finish to seal the game with Wolves' third goal. Victory means they jump to seventh in the table, one place and three points behind Manchester United. They began 2018 as a promotion-chasing Championship side but end it as a team in the top half of the Premier League with a famous win over a title contender. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         \"It is good for the dressing room but to play like this at Wembley - the home of football - is the big thing,\" Nuno said. \"We have achieved something very special in getting to the Premier League and it has been a very special year. \"The second half was really really good. We managed possession, had chances and goals. \"We had a lot of belief after the equaliser - I would have said a draw was a good result, but I cannot control the emotions of the boys if they see space in front of them.\" Tottenham's next game is on New Year's Day at Cardiff (17:30 GMT).

Harry Kane's stunning strike from range had given Spurs a first-half lead, but goals from Willy Boly, Raul Jimenez and Helder Costa turned the game around. Liverpool then thrashed Arsenal in Saturday's late kick-off to take advantage and go nine points clear.  Ainsley Maitland-Niles got his first goal for the Gunners to give the visitors an early lead, but two goals from Roberto Firmino, one from Sadio Mane and a Mohamed Salah penalty gave Liverpool total control by half-time. Firmino completed the rout, and his hat-trick, with a second-half penalty. Meanwhile, there were two late winners at the opposite end of the table.  Aleksandar Mitrovic struck in stoppage time to earn Fulham victory over fellow strugglers Huddersfield, after team-mate Aboubakar Kamara had a penalty saved. The win moves Fulham up to 18th but Huddersfield remain bottom, five points from safety. And Victor Camarasa's 92nd minute goal against Leicester earned Cardiff City their first away win of the season. The result sees Neil Warnock's side move up to 16th, four points clear of the bottom three. Watford rescued a point against Newcastle at Vicarage Road courtesy of  substitute Abdoulaye Doucoure's equaliser eight minutes from time. Salomon Rondon's fifth goal of the campaign had given the Magpies the lead, but Rafael Benitez side now have one win in their last seven league games.

In the Championship, the top two both suffered defeats as leaders Leeds United lost 2-0 at home to Hull City and Norwich City failed to take advantage. The Canaries eventually lost 4-3 to Derby County, after Frank Lampard's side scored twice late on to turn the game around.

He went into the game as the league's top scorer but had just 13 touches before being substituted in the 71st minute. To make matters worse, SIX of those touches were from the kick-off. Don't believe us? Here's his touch map to prove it. As the map shows, the Gabon international was only given the ball once in the Liverpool penalty area and more of his touches come in his own penalty area than Liverpool's. Aubameyang's 13 touches was his lowest total in any game he has started this season and only Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has had fewer touches when playing at least 70 minutes in the Premier League this season - he had 11 touches in 87 minutes for Leicester against Arsenal in October. Unsurprisingly, Aubameyang also made the fewest passes of any player to have played the majority of the match. He made just 10 passes although they were all successful so he ended the game as the only player with 100% passing accuracy.

The pair argued and designated spot-kick taker Mitrovic was furious after Kamara refused to give him the ball. \"He did not respect me, the club, team-mates and crowd. I spoke with him, it is not right,\" Ranieri told BBC Sport. Mitrovic, though, rescued the Cottagers with an injury-time winner. The Serbian coolly converted his eighth goal of the season on 91 minutes after being put through by Ryan Sessegnon. But despite Ranieri's anger, there seemed to be few hard feelings between the two players at the final whistle, as the relegation-threatened side celebrated their victory over the Premier League's bottom side. Mitrovic told BBC Sport: \"We had a small argument and I think it is my job for penalties. He did not think like this but I respect that. I have done the same in the past. \"I don't have a problem with this, he missed and that is part of football. He changed the game when he came on in the second half.\" Ranieri added: \"I said to Aboubakar Kamara to leave the ball to Aleksandar Mitrovic, he is the man who shoots the penalties. It is unbelievable what he did. \"I wanted to kill him. That is normal when one man takes a ball, only because he scored the last penalty (against Manchester United). It should be Mitrovic, that is it.\" Mitrovic said he felt like crying after missing several chances in his side's 1-1 draw at Wolves on Wednesday, but he proved to be the match-winner three days later. Fulham are now unbeaten in their last three games, keeping two clean sheets and though they remain in the drop zone, victory over Huddersfield lifted them up a place to 18th, just one point adrift of safety. A pleased Mitrovic on this occasion said: \"Last time I said I am so unhappy I want to cry, today I want to say I am so happy I want to cry. \"It is a big three points, we kept another clean sheet and that is a big improvement for us.  \"Today was a six-point game against rivals at the bottom and it was a very important game. It gives us confidence before facing Arsenal. We need to carry on winning games and taking points.\" Ranieri added: \"It was unbelievable. If we had to dream this match, it is important to score in the last minute and that is what we did.

Unseasonable heat in the dead of winter? Steven Gerrard's team turned up the temperature, that's for sure. Their victory was scalding and wholly deserved. After 10 defeats and two draws in 12 meetings with Brendan Rodgers' team that saw them produce performances that ran the gamut from A for Abysmal to Z for Zzzzz, Rangers finally stirred and gave Celtic a little glimpse of life on the other side. The Scottish champions turned up at Ibrox for a game of football. Rangers turned up for a battle. If this game was won, ultimately, by a goal from Ryan Jack, its foundations were built on attitude and work-rate and fitness to go like the clappers all day long, on Gerrard devising a perfect game plan that was carried out to the letter by an infinitely hungrier team. Not to mention Rodgers getting his team selection wrong and then it being exposed. The hosts hustled and harried Celtic to the point of distraction and disorientation. Dedryck Boyata, Scott Brown, Olivier Ntcham and others will wake up in the night imagining that Jack and Ross McCrorie were in the room with them, tipping them out of their bed. Scott Sinclair, Ryan Christie, James Forrest will think about the last time they were all so ineffective in a game of this kind. That'll take a while. None of Celtic's go-to men in attack were mapped.  Celtic's disintegration was something to see. Every pass - even the simple ones - became an adventure. For a spell, you waited for them to regain their composure and mount an assault down the other end, but you abandoned expectation pretty early in the day. Rangers' intensity was far, far too much for them.  Their only comfort - and it doesn't even amount to a crumb - was that they avoided the kind of outcome that would have been on sale as a DVD come Monday morning. By any reasonable analysis, on the balance of chances created, Rangers were at least three goals better than Celtic at the very minimum. Four would be closer to the mark. Five would not have flattered them.  At the end, the cameras turned to Gerrard in the most significant moment of his brief career in management. Gerrard needed this, no question. After dropping points in nine league games this season - and staring down the barrel of a six-point deficit on a Celtic team with a game in hand - he needed the validation that he was on the right track domestically. That even if Rangers don't win the league, that he shows himself capable of giving Celtic under Rodgers a bloody nose as others have done before him. Hibernian have done it, Hearts have done it, Kilmarnock have done it, Aberdeen have done it and now Rangers have joined the party at last at the 13th attempt since the Celtic manager hit town. From now until the end of the season, Gerrard can put this victory on the television screen in the team room and say, 'that's your level now, that's what your capable of, that's what we want every week, that's what will make us contenders'. For Rangers, the thought of beating Celtic is no longer an abstract thing. The win strips away a layer of Celtic's aura. Rodgers' team have now lost four league games in the first half of this season, which is the same number of losses they suffered in the past two league seasons put together. Talking about them being beatable is all well and good, but Rangers don't need to talk about it anymore. They've experienced it. The question for Gerrard is about consistency. Can he dig out displays like this on a regular basis going forward? Can he bring to an end soft points getting dropped on the road? Now that he's applying some heat to Rodgers' rear end, can he keep it applied or will a silly draw here and a weak loss there undermine it all?  The winter break is upon us but when they return to league action Rangers have a pocket of games that will tell us much about their durability in what we must now call a title race. Three points separate the top four clubs at the midway stage. How long it lasts is a moot point - Celtic remain hot favourites - but in the here and now there is a chase on for sure.  Those games facing Rangers are Kilmarnock (away), Livingston (away), St Mirren (home) and Aberdeen (away). Their travails have been mostly on the road in the Premiership this season. They've had a flakiness at Livingston, Motherwell and Dundee - where they should be winning - and it has hurt them. If they leave Rugby Park, the Tony Macaroni Arena and Pittodrie with nine points, they'll have built on what they achieved against Celtic on Saturday and the feeling will harden that, maybe, they are in this for the long haul.  There's a transfer window to negotiate in the meantime. Rangers made a \u00a314m loss in their last accounts but the temptation of seeing the whites of Celtic's eyes will surely see them spend again. Gerrard has already spoken about strengthening and his words will only take on greater persuasiveness after what happened at Ibrox. Another option up front is the first priority.  For Celtic, this should come as an awakening. They dozed their way through the summer window and their lack of action contributed heavily to their exit from the Champions League. It's now putting an element of doubt about their domestic dominance.  Mr Magoo can see what they need in the next window - one more striker, possibly two, and a right-back to replace Mikael Lustig. That's the least of it. Rangers exposed Celtic in the heart of the midfield where Brown and Ntcham were thunderously outplayed. That might give Rodgers food for thought also. He ought to be chastened by what became of his team at Ibrox. The same can be said of Peter Lawwell. The chief executive would never want Celtic to lose to Rangers, but losing so soon after it was reported that he is about to pocket a performance bonus of more than \u00a32m to go with his salary of \u00a31.1m is particularly wounding. That news will have gone down badly with the faithful, but it's grist to Rodgers' mill as he looks for proper money to reinvent his team. Like Gerrard showing his board the DVD of the game in a bid for new funds, Rodgers can do exactly the same for altogether different reasons.  The Celtic manager hasn't had many poor days in Scotland, but this was the worst of them. There's a little chink in the armoury now. And everyone can see it.

She told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed. Parliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it. The prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc. After Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects. The agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.

The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome. Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit. While she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\". \"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can. \"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\" A no deal Brexit could \"put the public at risk\" because of reduced security collaboration with the EU, says Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick #r4today https://t.co/v9XVVpWbcm pic.twitter.com/mABJ3J6ojW End of Twitter post  by @BBCr4today The Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit. She also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary. \"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.  \"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\" Ms Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU. But campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.  The organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.  \"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.  The Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.  \"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this. In the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers. She said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".  The authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working out what had happened and there would have to be much closer working between the private sector and the military to ensure there was no repeat.

Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said a no-deal exit would threaten access to EU-wide criminal databases and make it harder to extradite people from abroad. She told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed. Parliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it. The prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc. After Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects. The agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.  Please upgrade your browser The priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome. Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit. While she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\". \"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can. \"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\" A no deal Brexit could \"put the public at risk\" because of reduced security collaboration with the EU, says Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick #r4today https://t.co/v9XVVpWbcm pic.twitter.com/mABJ3J6ojW End of Twitter post  by @BBCr4today The Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit. She also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary. \"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.  \"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\" Ms Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU. But campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.  The organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.  \"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.  The Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.  \"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this. In the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers. She said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".  The authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working out what had happened and there would have to be much closer working between the private sector and the military to ensure there was no repeat.

The Chinese company's chairman has also complained of his firm's \"incredibly unfair treatment\" abroad. In recent weeks, the UK's Defence Secretary and chief of MI6 have been among those to warn that use of Huawei's 5G kit poses risks that need fuller consideration. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and Japan have also flagged concerns. Experts have warned that the Chinese government could compel the company to disrupt telecom networks that use its equipment or spy on their customers. But Huawei denies it would ever do so, noting that such action would undermine its business.  Last week, it invited the media to visit its 5G and cyber-security research labs in Dongguan, Guangdong as part of efforts to counter criticism.  Many of Huawei's clients opt for its products over rivals, such as Nokia and Ericsson, on both cost and technical grounds.  In addition, its smartphones have proven popular with the public.  Huawei recently revealed it had shipped more than 200 million handsets in 2018, placing it second only to Samsung in terms of market share.  \"We are ahead of others in domains like wireless, optical, data communications, and smart devices,\" wrote chairman Guo Ping in a New Year's message shared online. \"For 5G markets that choose to not work with Huawei - they will be like an NBA [National Basketball Association] game without star players: the game will go on, but with less deftness, flair, and expertise.\" Beijing's criticism of the UK was published in the Global Times, an English-language government newspaper. It said Ministry of National Defence spokesman Wu Qian had told a press conference that suggestions the Chinese government might compromise Huawei's technologies were \"groundless\". It said Wu's comment was made in reaction to UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson saying earlier this week that: \"We've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.\" Having made play on a Jane Austen novel title, the newspaper also referenced another popular phrase to offer advice to Huawei, telling it to \"calm down and carry on\" in a separate editorial.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46672550", "content": "BT has confirmed that equipment made by Huawei is being removed from the heart of a communication system being developed for the UK's police forces and other emergency services. It follows a statement from BT earlier this month that it was swapping out the Chinese firm's kit from the \"core\" of its 3G and 4G mobile networks. The Sunday Telegraph was first to report the latest development. It said the move could extend work on the late-running \u00a32.3bn project. BT is covering the cost of the switch. It does not believe the changeover will lead to a further delay. The Emergency Services Network (ESN) was originally due to be completed by the end of 2019. At that point it was meant to replace an existing Motorola-owned radio system called Airwave, which is used by the police, fire and rescue, and ambulance services. The ESN is intended to give its users \"secure\" priority access to EE's 4G network, which is being extended via additional radio frequencies in rural areas and new mast sites. It should be cheaper to run than Airwave while also providing superior voice and data capabilities. But the effort is overrunning, and in September the Home Office announced that it would pay for use of Airwave until the end of 2022 with scope for a further extension if required. EE won the contract to roll out the ESN in 2015, a year before the network provider was acquired by BT. Since then, it has become subject to a BT policy that Huawei's kit should not be used at the core of its mobile networks to push customers' data about. Instead, BT limits the equipment to periphery parts such as phone mast antennas. \"We have ongoing plans to swap to a new core network vendor for ESN, in line with BT's network architecture principles established in 2006,\" a spokesman for EE told the BBC. \"This will be managed with no disruption to the ESN service.\" He added that it was still EE's intention to offer \"full capability\" of the system by 2020. BT has not been explicit about the reasons behind its policy. But security concerns have been raised about the use of Huawei's network infrastructure products, with the chief of MI6 Alex Younger recently saying Britain needed to decide how comfortable it was \"with Chinese ownership of these technologies\". Even so, the Financial Times reported last week that telecoms executives are opposed to an outright ban, warning that such a move would set back deployment of 5G in the UK by up to a year. Huawei has repeatedly rejected suggestions that it poses a risk and denies having ties to the Chinese government beyond those of being a law-abiding taxpayer.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46370014", "content": "New Zealand government's move to prevent Huawei supplying a local mobile network with 5G equipment has raised questions about why the UK appears less concerned about use of the Chinese company's technology. A press release from Spark, the New Zealand company involved, said it had been deemed that the deployment posed \"significant security risks\" - a polite way of saying that Beijing might use the technology to spy on the country or disrupt its communications in a future dispute. The US and Australia had already closed the door on Huawei's involvement in their next-generation mobile networks. That means three members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance have now acted against the Shenzhen-based company. And one other member, Canada, is carrying out a security review of its own.  So, there's a prospect that the UK could soon be the sole holdout, allowing Huawei to play a key role in delivering the data that everything from self-driving cars to smart city sensors will rely on. \"There are two factors at play here: 5G will be connected to everything as we go to the internet-of-things,\" said Ewan Lawson, from UK defence think tank Rusi. \"And concerns about foreign-sourced hardware were less intense than they are now.\" For its part, Huawei has said: \"[We are] aware of Spark's statement and we are looking into the situation. \"As a leading global supplier of telecoms equipment, we remain committed to developing trusted and secure solutions for our customers.\" The government argues not. \"This government and British telecoms operators work with Huawei at home and abroad to ensure the UK can continue to benefit from new technology while managing cyber-security risks,\" a Cabinet Office spokeswoman told BBC News. That work includes a facility nicknamed the Cell, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where staff employed by Huawei but answering to GCHQ hunt for security flaws in the company's products. It has not uncovered evidence of hidden backdoors or other deliberate attempts of subterfuge. But its last report did identify shortcomings that led it to warn that it could offer only \"limited assurance\" that the company posed no threat. The UK government is also thought to have fired a shot across the bows last month, when it wrote to telecoms companies warning that a review of  their infrastructure could lead to \"changes in the current rules\" that should be taken into account during \"procurement decisions\". Huawei was not mentioned by name, but the Financial Times - which revealed the letter's existence - said some industry executives interpreted it to mean a ban was still possible. But others have their doubts, noting that other political factors are at play. \"The letter did go out but the issue remains that in the absence of any definitive evidence of a problem, an unspecific security risk has to be weighed against trade opportunities,\" said Mr Lawson. \"If Huawei was banned, we don't know the extent to which China might well refuse to do business with us in other fields - and the timing for that would not be great with so much attention on the potential economic impacts of Brexit.\" Huawei opened its first office in the country in 2001 and soon had its equipment adopted by BT and Vodafone, which used it to support 2G, 3G and 4G mobile services as well as \"superfast\" fibre and other types of broadband connections to homes and businesses. Its kit includes mobile phone radio antennas and the routers and switches found in kerbside cabinets. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - are now working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings.  O2's parent Telefonica has also tested its new equipment elsewhere and signalled that it might use it in the UK. In addition, Huawei says it has developed research and development partnerships with many of the country's leading academic institutions, including the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Cardiff and Imperial College. Its UK board of directors includes Lord Browne, the former chief of BP, and Sir Andrew Cahn, a former high-ranking civil servant.  The company is keen to portray itself as a private company owned by its employees with no ties to the Chinese government beyond those of a law-abiding taxpayer. It can also lay claim to being one of the biggest spenders on research and development - it invested more than $13.2bn (\u00a310.3bn) last year and has said the figure will be even higher for 2018. But critics like to point out that its media-shy founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. Furthermore, they question how free any major Chinese business can be from Beijing's influence. \"It's accepted practice in China that relationships between Chinese companies and the state have to be extremely close,\" said Prof Anthony Glees, director of the Buckingham University Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies. \"Many other countries have said no [to Huawei over 5G].  \"We've come to the matter late as we have already let them through the door.\" Another leading cyber-security expert agreed that Huawei could be co-opted into incapacitating the equipment it had sold. \"The obvious concern with 5G is whether there is a material risk of the Chinese being in a position to run a big denial-of-service attack on Britain in the event of a time of international tension,\" said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge. \"There is obviously a risk. China plays hardball and we have been hoping in vain for years that it would get nice as it got richer but that hasn't happened.\" For now, Beijing has been reticent to be seen to be too forceful in leaping to Huawei's defence. The Chinese government did warn against \"protectionism\" when a deal to sell Huawei's phones in the US fell through and then \"discriminatory practices\" when Australia banned local networks using its 5G equipment. But Chinese officials are already preoccupied with President Trump's threats of more trade tariffs and might see any effort to try to help Huawei as likely to backfire. Even so, eyebrows have still been raised by a decision to exclude its founder from a list of 100 key contributors to China's economy over the past 40 years recently published in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper.

It follows a statement from BT earlier this month that it was swapping out the Chinese firm's kit from the \"core\" of its 3G and 4G mobile networks. The Sunday Telegraph was first to report the latest development. It said the move could extend work on the late-running \u00a32.3bn project. BT is covering the cost of the switch. It does not believe the changeover will lead to a further delay. The Emergency Services Network (ESN) was originally due to be completed by the end of 2019. At that point it was meant to replace an existing Motorola-owned radio system called Airwave, which is used by the police, fire and rescue, and ambulance services. The ESN is intended to give its users \"secure\" priority access to EE's 4G network, which is being extended via additional radio frequencies in rural areas and new mast sites. It should be cheaper to run than Airwave while also providing superior voice and data capabilities. But the effort is overrunning, and in September the Home Office announced that it would pay for use of Airwave until the end of 2022 with scope for a further extension if required. EE won the contract to roll out the ESN in 2015, a year before the network provider was acquired by BT. Since then, it has become subject to a BT policy that Huawei's kit should not be used at the core of its mobile networks to push customers' data about. Instead, BT limits the equipment to periphery parts such as phone mast antennas. \"We have ongoing plans to swap to a new core network vendor for ESN, in line with BT's network architecture principles established in 2006,\" a spokesman for EE told the BBC. \"This will be managed with no disruption to the ESN service.\" He added that it was still EE's intention to offer \"full capability\" of the system by 2020. BT has not been explicit about the reasons behind its policy. But security concerns have been raised about the use of Huawei's network infrastructure products, with the chief of MI6 Alex Younger recently saying Britain needed to decide how comfortable it was \"with Chinese ownership of these technologies\". Even so, the Financial Times reported last week that telecoms executives are opposed to an outright ban, warning that such a move would set back deployment of 5G in the UK by up to a year. Huawei has repeatedly rejected suggestions that it poses a risk and denies having ties to the Chinese government beyond those of being a law-abiding taxpayer.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46370014", "content": "New Zealand government's move to prevent Huawei supplying a local mobile network with 5G equipment has raised questions about why the UK appears less concerned about use of the Chinese company's technology. A press release from Spark, the New Zealand company involved, said it had been deemed that the deployment posed \"significant security risks\" - a polite way of saying that Beijing might use the technology to spy on the country or disrupt its communications in a future dispute. The US and Australia had already closed the door on Huawei's involvement in their next-generation mobile networks. That means three members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance have now acted against the Shenzhen-based company. And one other member, Canada, is carrying out a security review of its own.  So, there's a prospect that the UK could soon be the sole holdout, allowing Huawei to play a key role in delivering the data that everything from self-driving cars to smart city sensors will rely on. \"There are two factors at play here: 5G will be connected to everything as we go to the internet-of-things,\" said Ewan Lawson, from UK defence think tank Rusi. \"And concerns about foreign-sourced hardware were less intense than they are now.\" For its part, Huawei has said: \"[We are] aware of Spark's statement and we are looking into the situation. \"As a leading global supplier of telecoms equipment, we remain committed to developing trusted and secure solutions for our customers.\" The government argues not. \"This government and British telecoms operators work with Huawei at home and abroad to ensure the UK can continue to benefit from new technology while managing cyber-security risks,\" a Cabinet Office spokeswoman told BBC News. That work includes a facility nicknamed the Cell, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where staff employed by Huawei but answering to GCHQ hunt for security flaws in the company's products. It has not uncovered evidence of hidden backdoors or other deliberate attempts of subterfuge. But its last report did identify shortcomings that led it to warn that it could offer only \"limited assurance\" that the company posed no threat. The UK government is also thought to have fired a shot across the bows last month, when it wrote to telecoms companies warning that a review of  their infrastructure could lead to \"changes in the current rules\" that should be taken into account during \"procurement decisions\". Huawei was not mentioned by name, but the Financial Times - which revealed the letter's existence - said some industry executives interpreted it to mean a ban was still possible. But others have their doubts, noting that other political factors are at play. \"The letter did go out but the issue remains that in the absence of any definitive evidence of a problem, an unspecific security risk has to be weighed against trade opportunities,\" said Mr Lawson. \"If Huawei was banned, we don't know the extent to which China might well refuse to do business with us in other fields - and the timing for that would not be great with so much attention on the potential economic impacts of Brexit.\" Huawei opened its first office in the country in 2001 and soon had its equipment adopted by BT and Vodafone, which used it to support 2G, 3G and 4G mobile services as well as \"superfast\" fibre and other types of broadband connections to homes and businesses. Its kit includes mobile phone radio antennas and the routers and switches found in kerbside cabinets. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - are now working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings.  O2's parent Telefonica has also tested its new equipment elsewhere and signalled that it might use it in the UK. In addition, Huawei says it has developed research and development partnerships with many of the country's leading academic institutions, including the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Cardiff and Imperial College.

In an interview for the BBC's Today programme, Margrethe Vestager criticised the tech giants for misusing data and failing to respect citizens' rights. New EU rules governing what could be done with data provided some protection, she said.  But she added that the need for more concerted action was becoming pressing. \"Over these 12 months our relationship with tech has both been darker and more muddy because it becomes increasingly clear that all the bright and shiny positive potentials of tech are at the risk of being darkened by forced misuse of data, manipulation, supervision, no respect of the citizen, no respect of individual rights,\" she told Martha Lane Fox who carried out the interview. \"There is an increasing awareness of the fact that we really need to do something and to do that together.\" Baroness Lane-Fox, who is a board member of Twitter, is guest editor of this morning's Today radio programme on BBC Radio 4. The past year's scandals have included: The tech firms' actions had changed views about how the industry could influence people and society, said Ms Vestager. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force in May 2018, gave people new privacy rights and more control over their data, but more work was needed, said Ms Vestager. The civil service was now talking about ways to force tech firms to be more \"transparent\" about what they did with data gleaned from people's uploads, shares and views, she added.  But Ms Vestager described herself as being positive about the future. \"One thing I do hope over the next 10 years is that we get a much more... transparent way of dealing with data and giving access to data,\" she said. \"I tend to be an optimist by choice. I think it's a moral obligation because pessimists don't seem to get anything done.\" But failure to act, Ms Vestager cautioned, could lead to situation in which one or two massive firms dominated use of our personal data. Baroness Lane-Fox asked if this meant that the commission would take concrete steps to break up monopolies or tackle markets where dominance stifled competition. Commissioner Vestager responded that while dismantling companies had served Brussels well in the past, the speed at which changes occurred in the tech sector made it a less appropriate response. Instead, she said, the commission might look at how larger firms got access to data and resources in a bid to limit their power. Regarding Brexit, Ms Vestager noted that European competition authorities had become stronger by working together. But she added that the UK had \"clever skilled people with a very strong dedication\" to making sure the market served consumers.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44224802", "content": "Tougher data privacy rules come into effect on Friday, impacting any organisation handling personal information linked to EU residents.

The European Commission said the firm had used the mobile operating system to illegally \"cement its dominant position\" in search. The firm's parent Alphabet has been given 90 days to change its business practices or face further penalties of up to 5% of its average global daily turnover. It has said it plans to appeal. However, it could easily afford the fine if required - its cash reserves totalled nearly $103bn at the end of March. At a press conference in Brussels, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said consumers needed choice. And she suggested the ruling could lead manufacturers to sell smart devices using different versions of the Android operating system to Google's, such as Amazon's Fire OS, which she said they had been prevented from doing. \"This will change the market place,\" she said. Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has blogged in response. \"Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,\" he wrote. \"Today's decision rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less.\" Ms Vestager previously fined Google \u20ac2.4bn ($2.8bn; \u00a32.1bn) over a separate probe into its shopping comparison service - a ruling the tech firm is in the process of appealing against. In addition, her team has a third investigation underway into Google's advert-placing business AdSense. Ms Vestager alleges that there are three ways that Google has acted illegally: Ms Vestager acknowledged that Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines. But she said that only 1% of users downloaded a competing search app, and 10% a different browser. \"Once you have it, it is working, very few are curious enough to look for another search app or browser,\" she said. The Competition Commissioner said that Google carried out its abuse at a time when the mobile internet was growing quickly, helping it ensure that its advertising-supported search service repeated the success it had already found on desktop computers. She cannot turn the clock back, but said the size of the fine had been based on the firm's search-related earnings from Android devices in Europe since 2011. She has, however, said the firm must now stop all of the practices outlined above and refrain from any measures with a similar goal. Russia may give one example of how this could be achieved. After similar complaints by the country's regulator, Google now offers Android users a choice between Google, Yandex and Mail.ru as the default search engine the first time they use the Chrome browser. Yandex in particular has benefited from this. Since the change in June 2017, the Moscow-based firm has seen its share of mobile search rise from about 34% to 46%, according to Statcounter. The European Commission first began scrutinising Android in April 2015, after a complaint by Fairsearch -  a trade group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members. It claims the case has dragged on for so long because Google had used \"every trick in its book to delay action\". But the group welcomed the commissioner's intervention. \"This is an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour in relation to Android\", said spokesman Thomas Vinje. \"It means that Google should cease its anti-competitive practices regarding smartphones, but also in other areas - smart TVs in particular - where it is foreclosing competition by using the same practices.\" A trade body representing mobile operators has also greeted the development. \"This will enable consumers to benefit from a greater choice of mobile services, and allow more players to innovate and offer new services in the market,\" said the GSMA's chief regulatory officer John Giusti. The European Commission had the power to fine Google up to 10% of its annual revenue. Based on its last annual report, that would have amounted to a maximum of $11.1bn (\u00a38.5bn).  The \u20ac4.3bn figure is, however, a record-sized sum for the commission. Earlier punishments include: Depending on your point of view, Margarethe Vestager is either the only global regulator really standing up to arrogant American tech giants - or a busybody trying to hobble innovative businesses because Europe can't build its own. But today's ruling shows the gulf that has opened up between US and European competition policies.  In the States the focus is on real and obvious harm to consumers in the form of higher prices or less choice. They also seem more sympathetic to the tech giants' argument that they can be easily toppled from their perches by feisty start-ups. European regulators tend to take a wider view of markets, worrying about a \"winner takes it all\" world, where a few mighty platforms appear to offer consumers a shiny world of free or very cheap goodies, but in reality are devoted to crushing any competition. This culture clash isn't going to fade away any time soon.  Cheered on by many who are concerned about Silicon Valley's dominance, Ms Vestager will not abandon her mission to tame the tech giants - and the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon will fiercely resist any regulation that they see as a threat to their lucrative business models.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46618582", "content": "Facebook has been caught on the back foot again over its data privacy practices, following an investigation by the New York Times.

These have undermined public confidence in Facebook, led to calls for new regulations and prompted demands for a leadership rethink. \"We have to seriously challenge the claim by Facebook that they are not selling user data,\" commented Damian Collins MP, chair of the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. \"They may not be letting people take it away by the bucket load, but they do reward companies with access to data that others are denied, if they place a high value on the business they do together. This is just another form of selling.\" The Irish Data Protection Commission, which takes the lead on Facebook in the EU, has issued a brief statement: \"We are aware of the media reporting from earlier today. We are currently assessing what next steps, if any, are required.\" Facebook, as ever, thinks it's being unfairly picked on. Indeed, as recently as this week, former security boss Alex Stamos described the Cambridge Analytica scandal as an overreaction. With its statement on Wednesday, Facebook took the same tone it has since this whole mess began in March: users gave consent, everybody knew, nothing to see here.  For added cheekiness, its statement linked to a piece in the New York Times from 2010 that seemed to reference at least one of the features revealed in this latest investigation. But what Facebook underestimates, continually, is the extent to which this year has produced a \"data-awakening\" among the general public, and how now is the time for the company to lay it all out on the table.  If I was a Facebook employee, or shareholder, I'd be telling Mark Zuckerberg: \"It's time to be completely open about who has or had access to data.\"  That's the only way to stop 2019 being like 2018: a drip-drip of headlines that have eroded Facebook's reputation, perhaps irreparably. The NYT bases its analysis on hundreds of pages of documents and dozens of interviews, the full details of which it has not shared. In total, it said the social network had special arrangements with more than 150 companies to share its members' personal data. Most of these, it said, were other tech firms, but the list also included online retailers, car-makers and media organisations, including the NYT itself, among others. Of the examples given it reported: Facebook has long maintained that it does not sell its users' data. But the NYT said that one of the arrangements it struck was to get contact lists from Amazon, Yahoo and Huawei, which it used to run its own People You May Know facility. The feature suggests more acquaintances users might want to add to their friends, which helps increase engagement. The firm distinguishes between two different types of relationships it formed. The first type it calls \"integration partnerships\". It defines these as arrangements that allowed others to offer Facebook's features outside of its own app or website. Facebook actually provided a long list of such partners to Congress in July. It said the arrangement made it possible for other companies to do things like consolidate posts from Facebook, Twitter and other social media providers in a single app, or provide alerts from a range of services via a web browser. But it noted that to do this, its members had to have signed into their Facebook accounts to give permission. It added that \"nearly all\" of these partnerships had been shut down in recent months. Facebook refers to the second type of arrangements as being \"instant personalisation\". It said these allowed other apps to see Facebook's private messages so that, for example you could send a song recommendation to a friend without having to leave Spotify's app.  The facility also ensured that if you deleted a message within a third-party app, it was also deleted in Facebook. \"No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission,\" added Facebook's product partnership chief Ime Archibong in a blog. \"Many news stories imply we were shipping over private messages to partners, which is not correct.\" Facebook said that users' public information was also shared so that, for example, you could see what TV shows your friends had watched within Netflix. Facebook said that for the most part, it ended its personalisation partnerships in 2014, but continued in some select cases into 2017. It acknowledged, however, that it had not always withdrawn the application programming interfaces (APIs) that allowed others to tap into its data, as it should have. \"We're in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them,\" it concluded. Microsoft has issued a brief statement saying: \"Throughout our engagement with Facebook, we respected all user preferences.\" The BBC understands it ended its Bing contract with Facebook in February 2016, and the social network's data stopped appearing in its search results at that point. Netflix has said that it stopped taking advantage of its ability to recommend content to members' Facebook friends in 2015 as the service had not been popular. \"At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so,\" it added. Spotify had indicated it was unaware of the degree of access Facebook had provided to it. Apple has also said that it was also not aware of its devices being granted special access. Yahoo said it only tapped into Facebook's data once users had opted in, and did not do so for advertising purposes. Yandex has said its arrangement was limited to users in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, and added that it stopped receiving Facebook's data in 2015. Amazon said it only used Facebook's information \"in accordance with our privacy policy\".  Part of the issue is that Facebook promised a US regulator - the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - in 2011 that it would not share user data without explicit consent. Facebook insists it has not breached that pledge, but some privacy experts suggest otherwise. Furthermore, despite Facebook executives claiming to have been transparent over the years about the firm's privacy policy shifts, campaign groups suggest new laws are needed to restrict its activities. \"Time and again Facebook has been unable to clearly and in plain language explain to people how the company is collecting, storing, sharing, and retaining people's data,\" a spokeswoman for Privacy International told the BBC. \"The sheer scope of the Facebook scandals in 2018 alone is mind-boggling and shows that data exploitation is a rampant and systemic.\" The other risk is that the more negative stories there are in the press, the more likely users are to quit Facebook and its other apps - including Instagram and WhatsApp - or at least stop sharing personal information with them.

In an open letter to the EU's competition commissioner, 14 European shopping comparison services said the measures put in place by the search giant to improve things, actually make matters worse. They urged the commission to demand a new remedy. Google said it had complied with the European Commission demands. The search giant has faced a seven-year long battle with the European Commission over its dominance in the search market.  In June 2017, European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager ruled that Google had abused its power by promoting its own shopping service at the top of search results, and demanded that it provide equal treatment to rival comparison sites in future. She issued a record fine of \u20ac2.42bn ($2.7bn; \u00a32.1bn) - the largest penalty the European Commission has ever imposed. She also demanded that Google end its anti-competitive practices within 90 days or face further costs. Google is still appealing against the fine, but has come up with a system that it says makes shopping fairer. It changed the shopping box, which is displayed at the top of search results, so that it is no longer  populated with just Google Shopping ad results, but gives space to other shopping comparison services, who can bid for advertising slots.  Google also agreed to separate its comparison shopping service from the main company and to ensure that it operated at arm's length. The advertising slots it bids for would not be subsidised by revenue from its main ad business, it said. Rivals described the auction process as \"neither compliant nor effective\". \"It has now been more than a year since Google introduced its auction-based 'remedy' and the harm to competition, consumers and innovation caused by Google's illegal conduct has continued unabated,\" the letter reads. The main concern is that the system forces rivals to bid away \"the vast majority of their profits\" while Google's own bids cost nothing. \"Its bids are just meaningless internal accounting, paid from one Google pocket into another,\" reads the letter. \"As long as placement is determined by auction rather than relevance, it makes little material difference whether competitors occupy none, some or even all of the available slots,\" it goes on. \"In all cases, Google is the main beneficiary of any profits derived from these entries, and consumers are the main losers.\" Shivaun Raff, the chief executive of lead complainant Foundem, told the BBC: \"People expect Google to deliver them the most relevant search results, but the truth is that Google is exploiting that trust and showing them results from advertisers who pay the highest price instead.\" In response to the letter, Google said: \"We allow all comparison shopping services to compete equally to show product ads from merchants on Google's Search results page. \"To help drive awareness amongst merchants who are unfamiliar with these new opportunities, we're currently offering incentives for them to work with comparison shopping services. One year on, both services that existed before the remedy and services that are new to comparison shopping are participating successfully.\" Some think that the EU action and Google's subsequent solution is a case of shutting the door after the horse has bolted. \"The bigger issue here is that Google Shopping is the most successful shopping service because of what the firm did in the past, by favouring themselves,\" said David Foster, director of research firm Frontier Economics. \"While the current remedies might seem like too little too late, any regulator gets nervous about meddling too much.\" The rivals also accuse Google of encouraging ad agencies to \"pose\" as shopping comparison sites. \"Realising that it will never be possible to populate its new auction with enough genuine comparison shopping services to create even the veneer of a functioning remedy, Google has now set about populating it with fake ones instead,\" the letter reads. In response to recent questions from reporters on whether this was true, Ms Vestager said that her team \"had noticed the practice\". The European Commission can overturn the solution put in place by Google and force it to rethink it.  And for every day that Google remains in non-compliance, it can impose daily fines of up to 5% of its global revenue. \"The Commission is already worrying about whether they got this right and they don't regard the matter as closed,\" said Mr Foster. \"Ms Vestager's agenda is all about cracking down on tech giants and she wants to be seen as being tough.\"", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45810059", "content": "Google is fighting a record \u20ac4.3bn ($4.9bn; \u00a33.8bn) fine for allegedly using the Android operating system to \"cement its dominance\" as a search engine. In July, the European Commission said Google's Android policies had \"denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete\". The company could face further fines if it does not change its practices. Google's appeal could take several years. \"We have now filed our appeal,\" the company said in a statement reported by the Financial Times. Google was accused of acting illegally because: Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines. But the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said only 1% of users downloaded a competing search app, and 10% a different browser. \"Once you have it, it is working, very few are curious enough to look for another search app or browser,\" she said in July. Following the fine, Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said Android had enabled \"rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices\". He said the decision \"rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less\". The company was given until the end of October to make changes to Android that would satisfy the EU's demands.It told the Financial Times that it had no plans to ask the EU to change that deadline. In 2017, Google faced similar complaints from the Russian regulator. It now offers Android users in Russia a choice between Google, Yandex and Mail.ru as the default search engine the first time they use the Chrome browser. Yandex in particular appears to have benefited from this change. Since the change in June 2017, the Moscow-based company has seen its share of mobile search rise from about 34% to 46%, according to Statcounter.", "label": "technology"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46712694", "content": "Dame June Whitfield - celebrated for her comic roles in BBC sitcom Terry and June and cult favourite Absolutely Fabulous - has died aged 93. The London-born actress was a regular fixture on TV and radio for six decades, starring in Carry On films, Hancock's Half Hour, and even Friends. At 89, she appeared in EastEnders as Sister Ruth, a nun with a secret about Kat Moon. At 92, she was made a dame. Her agent said she died peacefully on Friday night.  Tributes to her long and successful career in comedy are being made on Twitter. Julia Sawalha, who played her strait-laced granddaughter in Absolutely Fabulous, said Whitfield had been a \"great source of inspiration\" to her as a young actress but was \"far too humble to accept my adoration\". Fellow Ab Fab actress Joanna Lumley told ITV news she was \"heartbroken to lose such a darling friend\", who would \"always have a most special place in my heart\". She said she would never forget \"her sensational talent, humour and her generosity\".  Jane Horrocks, who played the ditzy character Bubble in the comedy, said her former co-star was a \"wonderful lady\", who was \"versatile, funny and generous\". Most of Whitfield's scenes during her three episodes on EastEnders were filmed opposite Jessie Wallace, who tweeted: \"A truly great actress and comedy legend. Working with June was a masterclass.\" Impressionist Rory Bremner called Whitfield the \"go-to comedy actress for three generations\". TV producer Jon Plowman, who worked on Absolutely Fabulous, said there was \"no-one with a better ability to just 'place' a line, always an act of utter precision\". Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live he described working with Whitfield: \"You would hand her a script, she would work out where the laughs were and then would very quietly wipe the floor with everybody else.\" Comedian Miranda Hart recalls a touching encounter with Whitfield who responded to an appeal for sponsorship for Edinburgh Festival early on in her career. And broadcaster Danny Baker said Whitfield was \"formidable, dependable, inimitable. A rock. A gem.\" Shane Allen, controller of BBC Comedy, described Whitfield as \"the North Star of British comedy\". \"Her spectacular career is unparalleled in its longevity, with seven decades of being a key element in numerous high profile and successful shows. She was the go-to female comedy performer of her generation and was always in demand from the cream of British comedy.\" Among those clamouring to work with her were Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper. On Thursday, BBC Surrey broadcast what turned out to be her final interview, in which fellow showbusiness veteran David Hamilton visited Dame June at her home to talk about her life and career. Dame June Whitfield was a constant presence in British post-war comedy. Often playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself \"a comic's tart\".

But from her early radio roles in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she made more than 1,300 appearances on radio and TV. June Rosemary Whitfield was born in Streatham, south London on 11 November 1925. Her father was a telephone company executive, her mother an amateur actress who pushed her young daughter into dramatics and dancing.  Trained at Rada, to which she attributed her hard work ethic, Whitfield took her first professional acting job in 1944.  She was soon in demand on stage, radio and later television, and her long and varied career made for some surprising connections.  When she appeared in the London production Ace of Clubs, she was befriended by the show's creator, Noel Coward, and spent weekends at his glamorous country home.  Later she joined the chorus line of South Pacific, with its American lead Mary Martin, dating the star's young son, a pre-Dallas Larry Hagman.  However, her husband of 46 years, Tim Aitchison, was not from the same industry, but a chartered surveyor. Whitfield's ability to conjure up characters and superb sense of comic timing kept her in demand from across the entire canon of British comedy.  Stars such as Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper all clamoured to work with her. She called her autobiography ...and June Whitfield, in recognition of the fact that she always got second billing. \"The greatest of show business mysteries,\" Denis Norden once said, \"was how anyone could contemplate doing a comedy show without June Whitfield.\" With Frankie Howerd, she recorded a version of the song Je T'aime, but even their spoof, complete with ironic heavy breathing, was considered too risque for the time and was famously banned by the BBC. Her most memorable radio role was in The Glums, Frank Muir and Denis Norden's spoof family soap, part of the popular show Take It From Here. For seven years as the long-suffering Eth, her most oft-heard line was the lamenting \"Ooh, Ron\", addressed to her hapless fiance.  And for two decades, she read the News Huddlines for her long-time friend and colleague Roy Hudd, in radio's longest-running audience comedy. Her first starring TV role came in the BBC sitcom Beggar My Neighbour in 1966. She went on to form her first working relationship with Terry Scott in Scott On..... before the pair teamed up again for Terry and June. The chemistry between the unflappable Whitfield and her hare-brained husband was so solid that many viewers believed they were married in real life.  Described as the apotheosis of undemanding, middle-class, primetime comedy, Terry and June attracted audiences of 15 million during its eight-year run. Whitfield described herself as living \"in the suburban corner, in real life and in the parts I've played. Very English, and nothing wrong with that\". She also became the face of a string of adverts for Birds Eye frozen ready meals with the punchline: \"It can make a dishonest woman of you.\" Her big screen appearances included four Carry On films, and, in 1996, the part of Aunt Drusilla in a film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure \"The Carry Ons were a nudging sort of humour, like seaside postcards,\" she said.  \"Not at all politically correct, which was always a good thing.\" In 1992, she became an unlikely icon to a new generation of fans with her portrayal of Edina's unworldly mother in the internationally successful Absolutely Fabulous.  Originally scheduled to appear in just one episode, she went on to become one of the show's most popular characters.  \"As Joanna Lumley says, Ab Fab made us born-again actresses,\" she commented. As the new century dawned, Whitfield continued a wide variety of roles including parts in Midsomer Murders and that retirement home for actors of a certain generation, Last of the Summer Wine. In 2009 she appeared in The End of Time, the Doctor Who episode that was the last for David Tennant. She was awarded an OBE in 1985 and CBE in 1998 and, in 2017, became a Dame.  Despite her success, Whitfield never wanted a lead role, explaining that she lacked the drive and confidence. And as the on-stage muse to stars like Hancock and Cooper, she was all too aware of the personal cost.  When they died prematurely, she attributed this to \"the responsibility, the stress and strain\" of carrying the show.

The chemistry between the unflappable Whitfield and her hare-brained husband was so solid that many viewers believed they were married in real life.  Described as the apotheosis of undemanding, middle-class, primetime comedy, Terry and June attracted audiences of 15 million during its eight-year run. Whitfield described herself as living \"in the suburban corner, in real life and in the parts I've played. Very English, and nothing wrong with that\". She also became the face of a string of adverts for Birds Eye frozen ready meals with the punchline: \"It can make a dishonest woman of you.\" Her big screen appearances included four Carry On films, and, in 1996, the part of Aunt Drusilla in a film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure \"The Carry Ons were a nudging sort of humour, like seaside postcards,\" she said.  \"Not at all politically correct, which was always a good thing.\" In 1992, she became an unlikely icon to a new generation of fans with her portrayal of Edina's unworldly mother in the internationally successful Absolutely Fabulous.  Originally scheduled to appear in just one episode, she went on to become one of the show's most popular characters.  \"As Joanna Lumley says, Ab Fab made us born-again actresses,\" she commented. As the new century dawned, Whitfield continued a wide variety of roles including parts in Midsomer Murders and that retirement home for actors of a certain generation, Last of the Summer Wine. In 2009 she appeared in The End of Time, the Doctor Who episode that was the last for David Tennant. She was awarded an OBE in 1985 and CBE in 1998 and, in 2017, became a Dame.  Despite her success, Whitfield never wanted a lead role, explaining that she lacked the drive and confidence. And as the on-stage muse to stars like Hancock and Cooper, she was all too aware of the personal cost.  When they died prematurely, she attributed this to \"the responsibility, the stress and strain\" of carrying the show.

Often playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself \"a comic's tart\".  But after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right. The actress always said she was \"very bad at getting round to things\".  But from her early radio roles in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she made more than 1,300 appearances on radio and TV. June Rosemary Whitfield was born in Streatham, south London on 11 November 1925. Her father was a telephone company executive, her mother an amateur actress who pushed her young daughter into dramatics and dancing.  Trained at Rada, to which she attributed her hard work ethic, Whitfield took her first professional acting job in 1944.  She was soon in demand on stage, radio and later television, and her long and varied career made for some surprising connections.  When she appeared in the London production Ace of Clubs, she was befriended by the show's creator, Noel Coward, and spent weekends at his glamorous country home.  Later she joined the chorus line of South Pacific, with its American lead Mary Martin, dating the star's young son, a pre-Dallas Larry Hagman.  However, her husband of 46 years, Tim Aitchison, was not from the same industry, but a chartered surveyor. Whitfield's ability to conjure up characters and superb sense of comic timing kept her in demand from across the entire canon of British comedy.  Stars such as Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper all clamoured to work with her. She called her autobiography ...and June Whitfield, in recognition of the fact that she always got second billing. \"The greatest of show business mysteries,\" Denis Norden once said, \"was how anyone could contemplate doing a comedy show without June Whitfield.\" With Frankie Howerd, she recorded a version of the song Je T'aime, but even their spoof, complete with ironic heavy breathing, was considered too risque for the time and was famously banned by the BBC. Her most memorable radio role was in The Glums, Frank Muir and Denis Norden's spoof family soap, part of the popular show Take It From Here. For seven years as the long-suffering Eth, her most oft-heard line was the lamenting \"Ooh, Ron\", addressed to her hapless fiance.  And for two decades, she read the News Huddlines for her long-time friend and colleague Roy Hudd, in radio's longest-running audience comedy. Her first starring TV role came in the BBC sitcom Beggar My Neighbour in 1966. She went on to form her first working relationship with Terry Scott in Scott On..... before the pair teamed up again for Terry and June.

But that's not the only treat 2019 has in store. From Stormzy to The Spice Girls, the next 12 months will see the return of the planet's biggest pop stars, and a few exciting new names taking their first steps into the big league. Here's a not-entirely-comprehensive preview of the year ahead.  2018 was a fallow year for most of pop's A-listers - with a knock-on effect on album sales, which fell by an estimated 25%. But the new year promises a crop of major releases that could reverse that trend. 1) Rihanna - To be confirmed It's been three years since Rihanna last graced fans with new music, but the long wait for a follow-up to Anti may soon be over.  In response to a fan asking \"When is the album dropping?\" on Instagram, the star simply stated: \"2019\". Her long-term vocal producer Kuk Harrell also teased details about Rihanna's ninth album, telling fans: \"R9 is great. R9 is amazing. It's incredible, And that's all I'm going to say.\" That's about all we know - although it's likely RiRi will also appear on the soundtrack to Guava Island, the mysterious film she's been shooting with Childish Gambino in Cuba. 2) Lana Del Rey - Norman Rockwell Back in November, Lana Del Rey released two singles that updated her trademark sound with a washed-out psychedelia. The highlight was the 10-minute-long Venice Bitch, a dreamy love song evoking faded summers, Robert Frost and Norman Rockwell - after whom she's named her sixth album. It's being produced by Jack Antonoff, whose work with Lorde, Taylor Swift and St Vincent has resulted in some of the most complex, intelligent pop of the last five years. The album is due in March, preceded by (uh-oh) a book of poetry. 3) The 1975 - Notes on a Conditional Form End of Youtube post  by BBCRadio1VEVO Recorded at the same time as 2018's A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, The 1975's fourth album is due in the summer - part of singer Matty Healy's plan to combat the constant-consumption culture of modern pop.  \"Very early on, [Matt] noted that the promotional window on music is shorter than ever, and the time that people consume it is infinite,\" the band's manager Jamie Oborne told Music Week. \"If we have a tour cycle that's going to last 18 months to two years, we have to release two records in the time that we would have previously have released one.\" Matty's father, actor Tim Healy, confirmed the band had recorded one of his songs for the album. 4) Dua Lipa - To be confirmed Like The 1975, Dua Lipa knows attention spans are getting shorter, so she's plugged the gap between her Brit Award-winning debut and her in-progress second album with a clutch of collaborations with Mark Ronson, Diplo, Calvin Harris and... er, Andrea Bocelli. Meanwhile, she's been hitting the studio with the likes of Max Martin (Britney, Taylor Swift) MNEK (Little Mix, Beyonce), Andrew Wyatt (Lorde, Bruno Mars), Sarah Hudson (Katy Perry, Camila Cabello) Justin Tranter (Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez) and Swedish pop star Tove Lo. The singer told Rolling Stone she'd been listening to Prince, Outkast and Gnarls Barkley in the studio, explaining the album \"has some throwback elements, which I'm excited about 'cause it's a new direction for me\". 5) Stormzy - To be confirmed \"They told me back in summer I should drop a summer tune/But I've been working hard, the second album's coming soon.\" Stormzy teased his new album in a freestyle, 4pm In London, earlier this year. And with a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon, we should expect new material sooner rather than later. Like his debut, Gang Signs & Prayer, the album's been recorded with producer Fraser T Smith, who said the star had reached new levels with \"his singing voice, the delivery of his raps [and] his musicality\". He told Music Week: \"There's no way he's going to be just recycling Gang Signs & Prayer.\" 6) Foals - To be confirmed Foals' first album since 2015's What Went Down is also their first without founding bassist Walter Gervers, and the indications are that it will see the band make a big sonic shift. \"It's evolution versus extinction,\" frontman Yannis Philippakis told the Oxford Union last year. \"What we need to do is go through some sort of violent change and make sure, whatever the next record is, it's not friends with the last two.\" 7) Ariana Grande - Thank U, Next End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Ariana Grande's Sweetener - which came sixth in our best albums of 2018 - was only released in August, but the pop star has already hit the studio to record the follow-up. That's partly because life has moved on - the love affair that inspired Sweetener's most romantic moments has ended - and partly because she's fed up with the music industry's relentless album-tour cycle. \"My dream has always been to be - obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does,\" she told Billboard. \"It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.\" The first single, Thank U, Next, topped the charts for six weeks in the UK, pushing back plans to release the album before the end of 2018, but it seems likely Ariana's fifth album will be out before her Sweetener World Tour kicks off in March. 8) Madonna - To be confirmed Madonna's 14th studio album [discounting her various soundtrack albums] is ready to roll, ahead of a rumoured Glastonbury appearance in June.  Tentatively titled Magic, it sees the star back in the studio with French \"disco god\" Mirwais, who co-produced Music and American Life; and Mike Dean, who's best known for working with Kanye West and Frank Ocean. She deliberately restricted her pool of collaborators after the anything goes approach of 2015's Rebel Heart, writing on Instagram: \"Remember when I made records with other artists from beginning to end and I was allowed to be a visionary and not to have to go to songwriting camps where no-one can sit still for more than 15 minutes?\" 9) Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings End of Youtube post 2 by BBCRadio1VEVO Trailed by the monumental Miley Cyrus collaboration Nothing Breaks Like A Heart, Mark Ronson's fifth record is a classic break-up album, prompted by his divorce from French model and actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume. Describing the project as a collection of \"sad bangers\", the producer told the BBC: \"I tried doing some other music, whatever I could do not to relive Uptown Funk, but the only stuff that started to stick was the stuff that moved me and made me feel melancholy.\" 10) Taylor Swift - To be confirmed The three-year gap between Taylor Swift's 1989 and Reputation was the longest she'd ever made fans wait for new music. But with a new recording contract signed and sealed, it looks like TS7 could be on its way by the end of 2019. Although nothing's confirmed yet, the star told Perez Hilton her seventh album \"will definitely be out before I'm 30\" next December, while fans are convinced she's teasing a new album via the medium of Scrabble tiles.  Let the games BEGIN. A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 21, 2018 at 12:55am PDT End of Instagram post  by taylorswift And that's not all... We're also expecting new albums from Vampire Weekend, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Childish Gambino, The Chemical Brothers, The Cure, Ellie Goulding, The Strokes, James Blake, Tame Impala, The Weeknd, Maren Morris, Missy Elliott, Run The Jewels, Solange, Grimes, Weezer, Marina and Bastille. With Charli XCX singing about 1999 and Anne-Marie reminiscing about 2002, nostalgia for the turn of the millennium is in full swing - so it only seems appropriate that The Spice Girls are heading off on their second reunion tour - without the help of Posh, who's apparently got a global fashion empire to oversee. Their 13-date stadium tour kicks off in Dublin on 24 May and rattles around the UK before landing in Wembley Stadium for three nights in June. If that's not enough 90s nostalgia for you, the new year will also see tours by Take That, Boyzone and Backstreet Boys. Massive Attack will also be back, staging an ambitious 21st anniversary production of their 1998 album Mezzanine, which they describe as \"our own personalised nostalgia nightmare head trip\". Over in Las Vegas, Lady Gaga ushers in the new year with a game-changing residency that juggles two shows - a greatest hits extravaganza and a more intimate piano-jazz soiree.  Former Vegas stalwart Cher, meanwhile, hits the road in the autumn for her first world tour in 14 years. With wry self-awareness, the show is titled The Here We Go Again Tour, and will focus on her recent album of Abba covers. The actual Abba are, for the 26th year in a row, refusing to reform, although a \"hologram tour\" is supposedly in the works, as is a TV special featuring two new songs from Sweden's finest. And palaeontologists will be pleased to hear that 2019 is a bumper year for rock dinosaurs - with Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, Sir Elton John, Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton all touching down in the UK.  Catch them while you still can... After the success of The Greatest Showman, Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star Is Born this year, Hollywood is scrambling to capitalise on the apparent appetite for musicals. 2019 will see new film adaptations of Cats, The Lion King and Aladdin, but the most-anticipated of the lot has to be the Frozen sequel, which is due in December. There's also a lot of buzz around Teen Spirit, which stars Elle Fanning as a shy Isle Of Wight teenager who enters an X Factor-style music contest. After its premiere in Toronto, Deadline said the film was \"reminiscent of a new-age Flashdance, only with the emphasis on singing instead of dancing\". Sir Elton's back catalogue will get an overhaul in Rocket Man - starring Taron Egerton as the bespectacled pianist; and directed by Dexter Fletcher, who rescued Bohemian Rhapsody from the scrap-heap when Bryan Singer was fired. And rounding out the year is Last Christmas, a romantic comedy inspired by Wham's holiday hit, which will also feature unreleased George Michael music.  End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Ones to watch for 2019 include Jade Bird, whose rip-roaring country-rock songs have lit up playlists on both sides of the Atlantic; and 17-year-old Billie Eilish, who currently gets 24 million monthly listeners on Spotify for her ominous tales of angst and obsession. Tyneside's Sam Fender has already won the Brits Critics' Choice Award for his emotionally-charged indie rock (check out Dead Boys, which tackles the issue of male suicide) while the longlist for the BBC's Sound of 2019 includes flamenco star Rosal\u00eda, R&B singer Ella Mai and queer pop songwriter King Princess. The winner will be revealed on 11 January. Nominations for the Brit Awards are announced a day later - with George Ezra locked on for best male and best album for Staying At Tamara's, the UK's best-selling new release of 2018. Arctic Monkeys, Clean Bandit and Florence + The Machine should also grab a nomination or two. At the Grammys, British star Dua Lipa is a frontrunner for best new artist, while Kacey Musgraves could be the first country act to win album of the year since 2010. Elsewhere, Childish Gambino, Cardi B, Janelle Monae and Drake all have multiple shots at the night's big prizes. But the biggest question mark hanging over the music industry in 2019 is the impact of Brexit.  How will the visa situation affect touring musicians? Will there be a price hike for vinyl and CDs, which are largely manufactured in Europe? And will Damon Albarn be forced to write another album about the political fallout?

The album is due in March, preceded by (uh-oh) a book of poetry. 3) The 1975 - Notes on a Conditional Form End of Youtube post  by BBCRadio1VEVO Recorded at the same time as 2018's A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, The 1975's fourth album is due in the summer - part of singer Matty Healy's plan to combat the constant-consumption culture of modern pop.  \"Very early on, [Matt] noted that the promotional window on music is shorter than ever, and the time that people consume it is infinite,\" the band's manager Jamie Oborne told Music Week. \"If we have a tour cycle that's going to last 18 months to two years, we have to release two records in the time that we would have previously have released one.\" Matty's father, actor Tim Healy, confirmed the band had recorded one of his songs for the album. 4) Dua Lipa - To be confirmed Like The 1975, Dua Lipa knows attention spans are getting shorter, so she's plugged the gap between her Brit Award-winning debut and her in-progress second album with a clutch of collaborations with Mark Ronson, Diplo, Calvin Harris and... er, Andrea Bocelli. Meanwhile, she's been hitting the studio with the likes of Max Martin (Britney, Taylor Swift) MNEK (Little Mix, Beyonce), Andrew Wyatt (Lorde, Bruno Mars), Sarah Hudson (Katy Perry, Camila Cabello) Justin Tranter (Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez) and Swedish pop star Tove Lo. The singer told Rolling Stone she'd been listening to Prince, Outkast and Gnarls Barkley in the studio, explaining the album \"has some throwback elements, which I'm excited about 'cause it's a new direction for me\". 5) Stormzy - To be confirmed \"They told me back in summer I should drop a summer tune/But I've been working hard, the second album's coming soon.\" Stormzy teased his new album in a freestyle, 4pm In London, earlier this year. And with a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon, we should expect new material sooner rather than later. Like his debut, Gang Signs & Prayer, the album's been recorded with producer Fraser T Smith, who said the star had reached new levels with \"his singing voice, the delivery of his raps [and] his musicality\". He told Music Week: \"There's no way he's going to be just recycling Gang Signs & Prayer.\" 6) Foals - To be confirmed Foals' first album since 2015's What Went Down is also their first without founding bassist Walter Gervers, and the indications are that it will see the band make a big sonic shift. \"It's evolution versus extinction,\" frontman Yannis Philippakis told the Oxford Union last year. \"What we need to do is go through some sort of violent change and make sure, whatever the next record is, it's not friends with the last two.\" 7) Ariana Grande - Thank U, Next End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Ariana Grande's Sweetener - which came sixth in our best albums of 2018 - was only released in August, but the pop star has already hit the studio to record the follow-up. That's partly because life has moved on - the love affair that inspired Sweetener's most romantic moments has ended - and partly because she's fed up with the music industry's relentless album-tour cycle. \"My dream has always been to be - obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does,\" she told Billboard. \"It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.\" The first single, Thank U, Next, topped the charts for six weeks in the UK, pushing back plans to release the album before the end of 2018, but it seems likely Ariana's fifth album will be out before her Sweetener World Tour kicks off in March. 8) Madonna - To be confirmed Madonna's 14th studio album [discounting her various soundtrack albums] is ready to roll, ahead of a rumoured Glastonbury appearance in June.  Tentatively titled Magic, it sees the star back in the studio with French \"disco god\" Mirwais, who co-produced Music and American Life; and Mike Dean, who's best known for working with Kanye West and Frank Ocean. She deliberately restricted her pool of collaborators after the anything goes approach of 2015's Rebel Heart, writing on Instagram: \"Remember when I made records with other artists from beginning to end and I was allowed to be a visionary and not to have to go to songwriting camps where no-one can sit still for more than 15 minutes?\" 9) Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings End of Youtube post 2 by BBCRadio1VEVO Trailed by the monumental Miley Cyrus collaboration Nothing Breaks Like A Heart, Mark Ronson's fifth record is a classic break-up album, prompted by his divorce from French model and actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume. Describing the project as a collection of \"sad bangers\", the producer told the BBC: \"I tried doing some other music, whatever I could do not to relive Uptown Funk, but the only stuff that started to stick was the stuff that moved me and made me feel melancholy.\" 10) Taylor Swift - To be confirmed The three-year gap between Taylor Swift's 1989 and Reputation was the longest she'd ever made fans wait for new music. But with a new recording contract signed and sealed, it looks like TS7 could be on its way by the end of 2019. Although nothing's confirmed yet, the star told Perez Hilton her seventh album \"will definitely be out before I'm 30\" next December, while fans are convinced she's teasing a new album via the medium of Scrabble tiles.  Let the games BEGIN. A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 21, 2018 at 12:55am PDT End of Instagram post  by taylorswift And that's not all... We're also expecting new albums from Vampire Weekend, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Childish Gambino, The Chemical Brothers, The Cure, Ellie Goulding, The Strokes, James Blake, Tame Impala, The Weeknd, Maren Morris, Missy Elliott, Run The Jewels, Solange, Grimes, Weezer, Marina and Bastille. With Charli XCX singing about 1999 and Anne-Marie reminiscing about 2002, nostalgia for the turn of the millennium is in full swing - so it only seems appropriate that The Spice Girls are heading off on their second reunion tour - without the help of Posh, who's apparently got a global fashion empire to oversee. Their 13-date stadium tour kicks off in Dublin on 24 May and rattles around the UK before landing in Wembley Stadium for three nights in June. If that's not enough 90s nostalgia for you, the new year will also see tours by Take That, Boyzone and Backstreet Boys. Massive Attack will also be back, staging an ambitious 21st anniversary production of their 1998 album Mezzanine, which they describe as \"our own personalised nostalgia nightmare head trip\". Over in Las Vegas, Lady Gaga ushers in the new year with a game-changing residency that juggles two shows - a greatest hits extravaganza and a more intimate piano-jazz soiree.  Former Vegas stalwart Cher, meanwhile, hits the road in the autumn for her first world tour in 14 years. With wry self-awareness, the show is titled The Here We Go Again Tour, and will focus on her recent album of Abba covers. The actual Abba are, for the 26th year in a row, refusing to reform, although a \"hologram tour\" is supposedly in the works, as is a TV special featuring two new songs from Sweden's finest. And palaeontologists will be pleased to hear that 2019 is a bumper year for rock dinosaurs - with Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, Sir Elton John, Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton all touching down in the UK.  Catch them while you still can... After the success of The Greatest Showman, Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star Is Born this year, Hollywood is scrambling to capitalise on the apparent appetite for musicals. 2019 will see new film adaptations of Cats, The Lion King and Aladdin, but the most-anticipated of the lot has to be the Frozen sequel, which is due in December. There's also a lot of buzz around Teen Spirit, which stars Elle Fanning as a shy Isle Of Wight teenager who enters an X Factor-style music contest. After its premiere in Toronto, Deadline said the film was \"reminiscent of a new-age Flashdance, only with the emphasis on singing instead of dancing\". Sir Elton's back catalogue will get an overhaul in Rocket Man - starring Taron Egerton as the bespectacled pianist; and directed by Dexter Fletcher, who rescued Bohemian Rhapsody from the scrap-heap when Bryan Singer was fired. And rounding out the year is Last Christmas, a romantic comedy inspired by Wham's holiday hit, which will also feature unreleased George Michael music.  End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Ones to watch for 2019 include Jade Bird, whose rip-roaring country-rock songs have lit up playlists on both sides of the Atlantic; and 17-year-old Billie Eilish, who currently gets 24 million monthly listeners on Spotify for her ominous tales of angst and obsession. Tyneside's Sam Fender has already won the Brits Critics' Choice Award for his emotionally-charged indie rock (check out Dead Boys, which tackles the issue of male suicide) while the longlist for the BBC's Sound of 2019 includes flamenco star Rosal\u00eda, R&B singer Ella Mai and queer pop songwriter King Princess. The winner will be revealed on 11 January. Nominations for the Brit Awards are announced a day later - with George Ezra locked on for best male and best album for Staying At Tamara's, the UK's best-selling new release of 2018. Arctic Monkeys, Clean Bandit and Florence + The Machine should also grab a nomination or two. At the Grammys, British star Dua Lipa is a frontrunner for best new artist, while Kacey Musgraves could be the first country act to win album of the year since 2010. Elsewhere, Childish Gambino, Cardi B, Janelle Monae and Drake all have multiple shots at the night's big prizes. But the biggest question mark hanging over the music industry in 2019 is the impact of Brexit.  How will the visa situation affect touring musicians?

Often playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself \"a comic's tart\".  But after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right. The actress always said she was \"very bad at getting round to things\".  But from her early radio appearances in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she featured in more than 1,300 radio and television shows.

But that's not the only treat 2019 has in store. From Stormzy to The Spice Girls, the next 12 months will see the return of the planet's biggest pop stars, and a few exciting new names taking their first steps into the big league. Here's a not-entirely-comprehensive preview of the year ahead.  2018 was a fallow year for most of pop's A-listers - with a knock-on effect on album sales, which fell by an estimated 25%. But the new year promises a crop of major releases that could reverse that trend. 1) Rihanna - To be confirmed It's been three years since Rihanna last graced fans with new music, but the long wait for a follow-up to Anti may soon be over.  In response to a fan asking \"When is the album dropping?\" on Instagram, the star simply stated: \"2019\". Her long-term vocal producer Kuk Harrell also teased details about Rihanna's ninth album, telling fans: \"R9 is great. R9 is amazing. It's incredible, And that's all I'm going to say.\" That's about all we know - although it's likely RiRi will also appear on the soundtrack to Guava Island, the mysterious film she's been shooting with Childish Gambino in Cuba. 2) Lana Del Rey - Norman Rockwell Back in November, Lana Del Rey released two singles that updated her trademark sound with a washed-out psychedelia. The highlight was the 10-minute-long Venice Bitch, a dreamy love song evoking faded summers, Robert Frost and Norman Rockwell - after whom she's named her sixth album. It's being produced by Jack Antonoff, whose work with Lorde, Taylor Swift and St Vincent has resulted in some of the most complex, intelligent pop of the last five years. The album is due in March, preceded by (uh-oh) a book of poetry. 3) The 1975 - Notes on a Conditional Form End of Youtube post  by BBCRadio1VEVO Recorded at the same time as 2018's A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, The 1975's fourth album is due in the summer - part of singer Matty Healy's plan to combat the constant-consumption culture of modern pop.  \"Very early on, [Matt] noted that the promotional window on music is shorter than ever, and the time that people consume it is infinite,\" the band's manager Jamie Oborne told Music Week. \"If we have a tour cycle that's going to last 18 months to two years, we have to release two records in the time that we would have previously have released one.\" Matty's father, actor Tim Healy, confirmed the band had recorded one of his songs for the album. 4) Dua Lipa - To be confirmed Like The 1975, Dua Lipa knows attention spans are getting shorter, so she's plugged the gap between her Brit Award-winning debut and her in-progress second album with a clutch of collaborations with Mark Ronson, Diplo, Calvin Harris and... er, Andrea Bocelli. Meanwhile, she's been hitting the studio with the likes of Max Martin (Britney, Taylor Swift) MNEK (Little Mix, Beyonce), Andrew Wyatt (Lorde, Bruno Mars), Sarah Hudson (Katy Perry, Camila Cabello) Justin Tranter (Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez) and Swedish pop star Tove Lo. The singer told Rolling Stone she'd been listening to Prince, Outkast and Gnarls Barkley in the studio, explaining the album \"has some throwback elements, which I'm excited about 'cause it's a new direction for me\". 5) Stormzy - To be confirmed \"They told me back in summer I should drop a summer tune/But I've been working hard, the second album's coming soon.\" Stormzy teased his new album in a freestyle, 4pm In London, earlier this year. And with a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon, we should expect new material sooner rather than later.

He told Music Week: \"There's no way he's going to be just recycling Gang Signs & Prayer.\" 6) Foals - To be confirmed Foals' first album since 2015's What Went Down is also their first without founding bassist Walter Gervers, and the indications are that it will see the band make a big sonic shift. \"It's evolution versus extinction,\" frontman Yannis Philippakis told the Oxford Union last year. \"What we need to do is go through some sort of violent change and make sure, whatever the next record is, it's not friends with the last two.\" 7) Ariana Grande - Thank U, Next End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Ariana Grande's Sweetener - which came sixth in our best albums of 2018 - was only released in August, but the pop star has already hit the studio to record the follow-up.

But after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right. The actress always said she was \"very bad at getting round to things\".  But from her early radio appearances in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she featured in more than 1,300 radio and television shows.

But that's not the only treat 2019 has in store. From Stormzy to The Spice Girls, the next 12 months will see the return of the planet's biggest pop stars, and a few exciting new names taking their first steps into the big league. Here's a not-entirely-comprehensive preview of the year ahead.  2018 was a fallow year for most of pop's A-listers - with a knock-on effect on album sales, which fell by an estimated 25%. But the new year promises a crop of major releases that could reverse that trend. 1) Rihanna - To be confirmed It's been three years since Rihanna last graced fans with new music, but the long wait for a follow-up to Anti may soon be over.  In response to a fan asking \"When is the album dropping?\" on Instagram, the star simply stated: \"2019\". Her long-term vocal producer Kuk Harrell also teased details about Rihanna's ninth album, telling fans: \"R9 is great. R9 is amazing. It's incredible, And that's all I'm going to say.\" That's about all we know - although it's likely RiRi will also appear on the soundtrack to Guava Island, the mysterious film she's been shooting with Childish Gambino in Cuba. 2) Lana Del Rey - Norman Rockwell Back in November, Lana Del Rey released two singles that updated her trademark sound with a washed-out psychedelia. The highlight was the 10-minute-long Venice Bitch, a dreamy love song evoking faded summers, Robert Frost and Norman Rockwell - after whom she's named her sixth album. It's being produced by Jack Antonoff, whose work with Lorde, Taylor Swift and St Vincent has resulted in some of the most complex, intelligent pop of the last five years. The album is due in March, preceded by (uh-oh) a book of poetry. 3) The 1975 - Notes on a Conditional Form End of Youtube post  by BBCRadio1VEVO Recorded at the same time as 2018's A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, The 1975's fourth album is due in the summer - part of singer Matty Healy's plan to combat the constant-consumption culture of modern pop.  \"Very early on, [Matt] noted that the promotional window on music is shorter than ever, and the time that people consume it is infinite,\" the band's manager Jamie Oborne told Music Week. \"If we have a tour cycle that's going to last 18 months to two years, we have to release two records in the time that we would have previously have released one.\" Matty's father, actor Tim Healy, confirmed the band had recorded one of his songs for the album. 4) Dua Lipa - To be confirmed Like The 1975, Dua Lipa knows attention spans are getting shorter, so she's plugged the gap between her Brit Award-winning debut and her in-progress second album with a clutch of collaborations with Mark Ronson, Diplo, Calvin Harris and... er, Andrea Bocelli. Meanwhile, she's been hitting the studio with the likes of Max Martin (Britney, Taylor Swift) MNEK (Little Mix, Beyonce), Andrew Wyatt (Lorde, Bruno Mars), Sarah Hudson (Katy Perry, Camila Cabello) Justin Tranter (Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez) and Swedish pop star Tove Lo. The singer told Rolling Stone she'd been listening to Prince, Outkast and Gnarls Barkley in the studio, explaining the album \"has some throwback elements, which I'm excited about 'cause it's a new direction for me\". 5) Stormzy - To be confirmed \"They told me back in summer I should drop a summer tune/But I've been working hard, the second album's coming soon.\" Stormzy teased his new album in a freestyle, 4pm In London, earlier this year. And with a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon, we should expect new material sooner rather than later. Like his debut, Gang Signs & Prayer, the album's been recorded with producer Fraser T Smith, who said the star had reached new levels with \"his singing voice, the delivery of his raps [and] his musicality\". He told Music Week: \"There's no way he's going to be just recycling Gang Signs & Prayer.\" 6) Foals - To be confirmed Foals' first album since 2015's What Went Down is also their first without founding bassist Walter Gervers, and the indications are that it will see the band make a big sonic shift. \"It's evolution versus extinction,\" frontman Yannis Philippakis told the Oxford Union last year. \"What we need to do is go through some sort of violent change and make sure, whatever the next record is, it's not friends with the last two.\" 7) Ariana Grande - Thank U, Next End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevo Ariana Grande's Sweetener - which came sixth in our best albums of 2018 - was only released in August, but the pop star has already hit the studio to record the follow-up. That's partly because life has moved on - the love affair that inspired Sweetener's most romantic moments has ended - and partly because she's fed up with the music industry's relentless album-tour cycle. \"My dream has always been to be - obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does,\" she told Billboard. \"It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.\" The first single, Thank U, Next, topped the charts for six weeks in the UK, pushing back plans to release the album before the end of 2018, but it seems likely Ariana's fifth album will be out before her Sweetener World Tour kicks off in March. 8) Madonna - To be confirmed Madonna's 14th studio album [discounting her various soundtrack albums] is ready to roll, ahead of a rumoured Glastonbury appearance in June.  Tentatively titled Magic, it sees the star back in the studio with French \"disco god\" Mirwais, who co-produced Music and American Life; and Mike Dean, who's best known for working with Kanye West and Frank Ocean. She deliberately restricted her pool of collaborators after the anything goes approach of 2015's Rebel Heart, writing on Instagram: \"Remember when I made records with other artists from beginning to end and I was allowed to be a visionary and not to have to go to songwriting camps where no-one can sit still for more than 15 minutes?\" 9) Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings End of Youtube post 2 by BBCRadio1VEVO Trailed by the monumental Miley Cyrus collaboration Nothing Breaks Like A Heart, Mark Ronson's fifth record is a classic break-up album, prompted by his divorce from French model and actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume. Describing the project as a collection of \"sad bangers\", the producer told the BBC: \"I tried doing some other music, whatever I could do not to relive Uptown Funk, but the only stuff that started to stick was the stuff that moved me and made me feel melancholy.\" 10) Taylor Swift - To be confirmed The three-year gap between Taylor Swift's 1989 and Reputation was the longest she'd ever made fans wait for new music. But with a new recording contract signed and sealed, it looks like TS7 could be on its way by the end of 2019. Although nothing's confirmed yet, the star told Perez Hilton her seventh album \"will definitely be out before I'm 30\" next December, while fans are convinced she's teasing a new album via the medium of Scrabble tiles.  Let the games BEGIN. A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 21, 2018 at 12:55am PDT End of Instagram post  by taylorswift And that's not all... We're also expecting new albums from Vampire Weekend, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Childish Gambino, The Chemical Brothers, The Cure, Ellie Goulding, The Strokes, James Blake, Tame Impala, The Weeknd, Maren Morris, Missy Elliott, Run The Jewels, Solange, Grimes, Weezer, Marina and Bastille. With Charli XCX singing about 1999 and Anne-Marie reminiscing about 2002, nostalgia for the turn of the millennium is in full swing - so it only seems appropriate that The Spice Girls are heading off on their second reunion tour - without the help of Posh, who's apparently got a global fashion empire to oversee. Their 13-date stadium tour kicks off in Dublin on 24 May and rattles around the UK before landing in Wembley Stadium for three nights in June. If that's not enough 90s nostalgia for you, the new year will also see tours by Take That, Boyzone and Backstreet Boys. Massive Attack will also be back, staging an ambitious 21st anniversary production of their 1998 album Mezzanine, which they describe as \"our own personalised nostalgia nightmare head trip\". Over in Las Vegas, Lady Gaga ushers in the new year with a game-changing residency that juggles two shows - a greatest hits extravaganza and a more intimate piano-jazz soiree.  Former Vegas stalwart Cher, meanwhile, hits the road in the autumn for her first world tour in 14 years. With wry self-awareness, the show is titled The Here We Go Again Tour, and will focus on her recent album of Abba covers. The actual Abba are, for the 26th year in a row, refusing to reform, although a \"hologram tour\" is supposedly in the works, as is a TV special featuring two new songs from Sweden's finest. And palaeontologists will be pleased to hear that 2019 is a bumper year for rock dinosaurs - with Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, Sir Elton John, Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton all touching down in the UK.  Catch them while you still can... After the success of The Greatest Showman, Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star Is Born this year, Hollywood is scrambling to capitalise on the apparent appetite for musicals. 2019 will see new film adaptations of Cats, The Lion King and Aladdin, but the most-anticipated of the lot has to be the Frozen sequel, which is due in December. There's also a lot of buzz around Teen Spirit, which stars Elle Fanning as a shy Isle Of Wight teenager who enters an X Factor-style music contest. After its premiere in Toronto, Deadline said the film was \"reminiscent of a new-age Flashdance, only with the emphasis on singing instead of dancing\". Sir Elton's back catalogue will get an overhaul in Rocket Man - starring Taron Egerton as the bespectacled pianist; and directed by Dexter Fletcher, who rescued Bohemian Rhapsody from the scrap-heap when Bryan Singer was fired. And rounding out the year is Last Christmas, a romantic comedy inspired by Wham's holiday hit, which will also feature unreleased George Michael music.  End of Youtube post  by BBC Music Ones to watch for 2019 include Jade Bird, whose rip-roaring country-rock songs have lit up playlists on both sides of the Atlantic; and 17-year-old Billie Eilish, who currently gets 24 million monthly listeners on Spotify for her ominous tales of angst and obsession. Tyneside's Sam Fender has already won the Brits Critics' Choice Award for his emotionally-charged indie rock (check out Dead Boys, which tackles the issue of male suicide) while the longlist for the BBC's Sound of 2019 includes flamenco star Rosal\u00eda, R&B singer Ella Mai and queer pop songwriter King Princess. The winner will be revealed on 11 January. Nominations for the Brit Awards are announced a day later - with George Ezra locked on for best male and best album for Staying At Tamara's, the UK's best-selling new release of 2018. Arctic Monkeys, Clean Bandit and Florence + The Machine should also grab a nomination or two. At the Grammys, British star Dua Lipa is a frontrunner for best new artist, while Kacey Musgraves could be the first country act to win album of the year since 2010. Elsewhere, Childish Gambino, Cardi B, Janelle Monae and Drake all have multiple shots at the night's big prizes. But the biggest question mark hanging over the music industry in 2019 is the impact of Brexit.  How will the visa situation affect touring musicians?

She said she would never forget \"her sensational talent, humour and her generosity\".  Jane Horrocks, who played the ditzy character Bubble in the comedy, said her former co-star was a \"wonderful lady\", who was \"versatile, funny and generous\". Most of Whitfield's scenes during her three episodes on EastEnders were filmed opposite Jessie Wallace, who tweeted: \"A truly great actress and comedy legend. Working with June was a masterclass.\" Impressionist Rory Bremner called Whitfield the \"go-to comedy actress for three generations\". RIP June Whitfield- go-to comedy actress for 3 generations, from 60s radio to 70s, 80s, even 90s TV. Always graceful & elegant with a real comic glint in her eye & (absolutely) fabulous timing. End of Twitter post  by @rorybremner TV producer Jon Plowman, who worked on Absolutely Fabulous, said there was \"no-one with a better ability to just 'place' a line, always an act of utter precision\". Very sad at the news of the death of the wonderful June Whitfield . There was no-one with more warmth or a better ability to just \"place\" a line ,always an act of utter precision. Hit after hit! Take it from Here Terry and June Absolutely Fabulous over seven decade. A great loss End of Twitter post  by @bimpsonbun1 Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live he described working with Whitfield: \"You would hand her a script, she would work out where the laughs were and then would very quietly wipe the floor with everybody else.\" Comedian Miranda Hart recalls a touching encounter with Whitfield, who responded to an appeal for sponsorship for Edinburgh Festival early on in her career. So very sad. I once sent a letter to many actors as a budding (I mean desperate) comedy actor to ask for sponsorship for the Edinburgh Festival. Dame June replied. Fifteen years later when I met her she had all my letters and the notes of the show she sponsored. I cried then too. https://t.co/oaGXd7ick4 End of Twitter post  by @mermhart John Challis, who worked with Whitfield in the sitcom The Green, Green Grass, said her timing and characterisation made life \"a bit better and a bit more charming\". And broadcaster Danny Baker said Whitfield was \"formidable, dependable, inimitable. A rock. A gem.\" Shane Allen, controller of BBC Comedy, described Whitfield as \"the North Star of British comedy\". \"Her spectacular career is unparalleled in its longevity, with seven decades of being a key element in numerous high profile and successful shows. She was the go-to female comedy performer of her generation and was always in demand from the cream of British comedy.\" Among those clamouring to work with her were Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper. On Thursday, BBC Surrey broadcast what turned out to be her final interview, in which fellow showbusiness veteran David Hamilton visited Dame June at her home to talk about her life and career. We will replay what has sadly turned out to be #JuneWhitfield\u2019s final interview, given to David Hamilton, as a tribute to a truly wonderful actress, Sunday 12-1pm.
