His most acclaimed works included the best-selling 2002 autobiographical novel A Tale of Love and Darkness. It was adapted for the big screen in 2015, directed by Natalie Portman. Early support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict led some to brand Oz a traitor - which he said he wore as \"a badge of honour\". The news of his death was announced by his daughter, historian Fania Oz-Salzberger. \"My beloved father passed away from cancer, just now, after a rapid deterioration, when he was sleeping at peace, surrounded by the people who love him,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Please respect our privacy. I will not be able to comment. Thank you to those who loved him.\" Oz was one of Israel's most widely-read and best-known writers, winning awards including the Israel Prize, the German Heinrich Heine prize, the French Legion d'Honeur and a membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  His books have been translated into 45 languages and he was often tipped as a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was born Amos Klausner in Jerusalem in 1939, and the city would provide a canvas for many of his works. His breakthrough novel, 1968's My Michael, was written while he worked in a kibbutz and describes the love and marriage of a young woman against the background of 1950s Jerusalem. Referring to A Tale of Love and Darkness, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said: \"It was a tale of love and light, and now, a great darkness. \"Rest in peace, dear Amos. You gave us great pleasure.\" BBC News producer Gidi Kleiman said the author was \"a voice for liberal Israel and the search for peace with the Palestinians\". Author and journalist Jonathan Freedland added that Oz was \"a guiding light to all those who longed for a just Israel, living in peace with its neighbours\". Distraught to hear of the death of Amos Oz, a guiding light to all those who longed for a just Israel, living in peace with its neighbours. His loss is immense - and may his memory be a blessing End of Twitter post  by @Freedland He was a longstanding advocate of the creation of a Palestinian state and in a 1996 interview said the only way to find peace was by establishing two states through \"painful compromise\".  He said: \"We need to divide it. We need to work out a mutually acceptable compromise.\" Speaking to BBC Two's Newsnight in 2016 about the reaction to his views in his home country, he said: \"I've been called a traitor many times in my life. I think I'm in wonderful company. \"History is full of people, men and women, who happened to be ahead of their time and were accused of treason by some of their contemporaries.\" End of Youtube post  by BBC Newsnight In recent years, Oz spoke out against the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, shunning official Israeli functions abroad in protest at what he called the \"growing extremism\" of his country's government. \"I can tell you where I draw the line,\" he told Newsnight. \"If people call Israel nasty, I - to some degree - agree. If they called Israel the devil incarnate, I think they are obsessed, I think they are mad, but this is still legitimate.  \"But if they carry on saying there should be no Israel, that's where anti-Zionism becomes anti-Semitism.\"  Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon called Oz's death \"a loss for us all and for the world\".", "label": "entertainment"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/46708529", "content": "India moved to within two wickets of victory in the third Test after Australia finished day four needing 141 more runs to win in Melbourne. Australia were set 399 to win but following a top-order collapse, pace bowler Pat Cummins finished unbeaten on 61 to help the hosts reach 258-8. Earlier, Cummins had taken a career-best 6-27 when India declared their second innings on 106-8 before lunch. Victory for either side would earn them a 2-1 lead in the four-Test series. India had begun the day on 54-5, a lead of 346, with Mayank Agarwal making his way to 42 but captain Virat Kohli declared immediately when wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant fell for 33. Australia then lost both their openers inside 10 overs as Aaron Finch was caught by Kohli at second slip for three, and Marcus Harris was caught at short leg off Ravindra Jadeja for 13. Left-arm spinner Jadeja later returned to dismiss the recalled Mitchell Marsh and keeper-captain Tim Paine to leave Australia relying on their lower order. But Cummins kept the game alive, adding his highest Test innings to his best first-class bowling figures, resisting for 103 balls. Though he lost Mitchell Starc for 18, Cummins and Nathan Lyon have added 43 for the ninth wicket in 14 overs to maintain hopes of an unlikely victory on day five. The highest successful fourth-innings run chase at the MCG came in 1928, when England made 332-7.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46712565", "content": "Liverpool have had chances to win their first title since 1990 before - but they have never had a bigger or better opportunity than they will have this season. The clock can be turned back to Steven Gerrard's catastrophic slip as Liverpool lost at home to Chelsea in 2014, a defeat that opened the door for Manchester City to rip the crown from their grasp. And there was the outstanding campaign under Rafael Benitez in 2008-09 when Liverpool lost only two league games out of 38 but still ended up in second place, four points behind champions Manchester United. This time, however, feels different.  This season feels like the opening Liverpool have waited almost 29 years for - created by manager Jurgen Klopp's potent blend of expensively assembled defensive solidity, in the shape of \u00a375m defender Virgil van Dijk and \u00a367m goalkeeper Alisson, and ferociously threatening attack. Liverpool's stars are aligned and even though Klopp and his players - Dejan Lovren's recent mention of an unbeaten season apart - will never tempt fate, they will be acutely aware of the opportunity they now have. Klopp's side are nine points clear of Tottenham after the north Londoners' shock home defeat by Wolves and 10 ahead of Manchester City, who visit Southampton on Sunday. They are unbeaten after 20 Premier League games and every key player in the team, and indeed the team as a whole, is hitting a peak. Yes, they could almost touch the finishing line in 2014, but they were under pressure with City right on their shoulder. This feels like a Liverpool team in control of the Premier League and its own destiny. Liverpool and Klopp will know the acid test is approaching when they visit Etihad Stadium on 3 January - but what riches they have in the bank with the knowledge that, at worst, they will start that game with a seven-point advantage over Pep Guardiola's reigning champions. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The suggestion that their unbeaten run has somehow broken Manchester City's resolve, worn them down, is a nonsense - and disrespectful to the quality of players and characters Guardiola has assembled. What is beyond question, however, is that Liverpool have taken control of this Premier League title race with a verve and momentum that currently looks like it will take some stopping. The fans can sense it too.  Anfield has had false dawns before, but Liverpool and Klopp gained the total trust of their supporters in that thrilling run to the Champions League final last season. And they have simply carried on where they left off, aided by key additions such as Alisson, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri. Supporters swarmed around the team bus on its arrival for the Arsenal game and a huge roar swept around the stadium once the immediate shock of Ainsley Maitland-Niles giving Arsenal the lead had dissipated. Liverpool were asked the question and the answer could not have been more emphatic. Nerves? Pressure? Not here as, led by Roberto Firmino's hat-trick, they gathered themselves in seconds and simply blitzed Arsenal. And whereas the ill-fated 2014 title run was an adrenalin-fuelled thrill ride from the turn of the year, led by Luis Suarez's brilliance and characterised by Gerrard's emotional \"this does not slip\" speech in a huddle of Liverpool's players after a win against Manchester City put the title in sight, this feels controlled, relaxed, even ruthless. Liverpool had Suarez, Daniel Sturridge in prime form and the tyro Raheem Sterling doing the damage back then while it is Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah now. There is, however, one decisive difference. Liverpool have only conceded eight goals in their first 20 league games. In 2013-14, they shipped 50. They are currently 31 league games unbeaten at Anfield and have conceded only 13 goals in that time. Salah felt confident enough, and the entire team comfortable enough at 4-1, to allow Firmino to take over penalty duties to complete his hat-trick, while a volley from Jordan Henderson that set sail in the direction of Liverpool city centre was greeted with a colourful response from The Kop, which the captain acknowledged with a beaming smile and arms raised aloft. Klopp will do his best to keep the lid on title talk but Liverpool's performances, and the manner in which opponents are now being devastated in similar fashion to last term, makes the task increasingly difficult. Liverpool are now Premier League title favourites. No debate. The door is open and if Manchester City do not wrest something from them on Thursday, then 2019 can be the year the great drought, the era in which they lost their status as the great domestic superpower, can be ended.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/46714457", "content": "Nick Kyrgios says he is ready to defend his Brisbane International title despite being taken to hospital on Christmas Day with a spider bite. The Australian, 23, was put on antibiotics after waking with a swollen foot, but practised in Brisbane on Saturday. The world number 35 will face American Ryan Harrison, whom he beat in the 2018 final, in the first round on Monday. \"I didn't take it (bite) seriously,\" said eighth seed Kyrgios. \"I just felt an irritation on my foot the day before Christmas. There's worse things in the world but I think I'll be OK.\" As he prepares to return for the first time since October, Kyrgios said he plans to reduce his 2019 schedule after struggling with his mental health last season. He endured a frustrating 2018, dropping from 21 in the rankings before being forced to cut his season short because of a recurring elbow injury. \"Just being away from home was the toughest bit,\" Kyrgios said. \"Battling injuries, going to tournaments and not even playing was tough, but they're not really big problems. \"I'll have a lighter schedule and when I play, enjoy playing and just compete.\" He added: \"Being home solved a lot of my problems. It was more mental than anything. I was away from home for five and a half months. I don't ever want to do that again. \"If I was to win the US Open or something, I won't play again for the rest of the year.\" Kyrgios could meet Japanese second seed Kei Nishikori in the semi-finals in Brisbane, with Britain's Kyle Edmund - seeded third - in the same side of the draw. On the other side, Britain's Andy Murray returns and will face Australia's James Duckworth in the first round. He could play Spain's Rafael Nadal in the semis. Meanwhile, Britain's Harriet Dart qualified for the main draw of the women's singles by beating former world number nine Andrea Petkovic.

Sri Lanka began the final day on 231-6 chasing an implausible 660, but folded within 14 balls. Angelo Mathews, who retired hurt with a hamstring injury on day four, could not resume his innings as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 236. A fourth successive series win lifted New Zealand into third in the International Cricket Council rankings. \"That's quite a cool thing to achieve,\" said captain Kane Williamson. Tom Latham made 176 and Henry Nicholls 162 not out, adding 214 for the fourth wicket, as New Zealand made 585-4 declared in their second innings. Although Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis, with 56 and 67 respectively, enabled Sri Lanka to stretch the game into a fifth day, no other batsman passed 22 as NeiL Wagner finished with 4-48. Mathews has been ruled out of the three-match one-day series starting on 3 January and the Twenty20 international on 11 January. \"Angelo had a scan last night, and it's a grade two hamstring strain. The physio said he's out for four weeks,\" said Chandimal. The all-rounder, who has been plagued by injuries in the last couple of years, may also be a doubt for the two-Test series in Australia which begins on 24 January.", "label": "sports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46656879", "content": "Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said his players \"are not machines\" after their title hopes suffered an unexpected setback thanks to a dramatic comeback win by Wolves at Wembley. Spurs led through Harry Kane's spectacular 25-yard strike in the first half but Wolves punished a poor second-half performance, scoring three times in the final 18 minutes to end their hosts' five-game winning run. The north London side would have moved only three points behind leaders Liverpool with a win, but the defeat and the Reds' 5-1 win over Arsenal means the Merseyside club ended the day nine points clear. \"We have had a very good run in the last few weeks and to keep that level is difficult,\" said Pochettino, whose side won 6-2 and 5-0 against Everton and Bournemouth respectively in their last two games. \"We tried to play a little more in the second half, but we were too direct and I think we started to pay for the effort in the other games.  \"We are not machines. We need to understand that we cannot get ourselves in this situation.\" Willy Boly brought the visitors level with a powerful header in the 72nd minute and Raul Jimenez then beat Hugo Lloris with a weak effort from the edge of the area to put Wolves in front. Helder Costa added a third on the counter-attack three minutes from time. Spurs, who did not have a single shot in the second half, remain second in the table but Manchester City can go back above them when they visit Southampton on Sunday. Spurs' performance in the second half was in a stark contrast to their previous two games, when they scored 11 goals. That free-scoring form had led manager Pochettino to admit his side were \"intruders\" in the title race, but a fifth league defeat of the season halts the momentum they had built. The north London side played well in the first half and had 10 efforts on goal, though most - including Kane's goal - came from distance. Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min were particularly lively. But after the break they were flat and lacked cohesion, the influence of Kane, Son and Eriksen diminished, and the introduction of Lucas Moura failed to spark them into life. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         The tension inside Wembley increased as the home support witnessed their team lose control of the game as Wolves, who had barely threatened in the first half, grew in confidence. After Boly's deserved equaliser, the Spurs fans tried to squeeze more from their team but it was Wolves, helped by some slack defending, who created all of the chances late on. \"We did not dominate the ball in the second half,\" Pochettino said.  \"We were wrong in the way we tried to play, too much long ball and our energy dropped in the second half.\" Wolves' fans, players and manager Nuno Espirito Santo celebrated wildly at full-time. They did not create chances in the opening 45 minutes but, unlike Everton and Bournemouth before them, defended well enough to stay in the game. Then, when Spurs' performance dipped, they began to exert control on the game and Nuno made the right substitutions. Joao Moutinho was introduced to the base of midfield in the 68th minute and dictated play, as well as providing the pin-point cross from the set-piece for Boly's equaliser. Striker Costa, meanwhile, came on in the 59th minute and made an excellent run before a clinical low finish to seal the game with Wolves' third goal. Victory means they jump to seventh in the table, one place and three points behind Manchester United. They began 2018 as a promotion-chasing Championship side but end it as a team in the top half of the Premier League with a famous win over a title contender. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                         \"It is good for the dressing room but to play like this at Wembley - the home of football - is the big thing,\" Nuno said. \"We have achieved something very special in getting to the Premier League and it has been a very special year. \"The second half was really really good. We managed possession, had chances and goals. \"We had a lot of belief after the equaliser - I would have said a draw was a good result, but I cannot control the emotions of the boys if they see space in front of them.\" Tottenham's next game is on New Year's Day at Cardiff (17:30 GMT).
